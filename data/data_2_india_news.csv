However, only select iPhone models will get the new iOS 17 update. People who are still using the older iPhones will not get to experience the iOS 17. For example, if you own an iPhone X or the iPhone 7 from 2017 or an older model, you might miss out on these updates. The new software introduces a Standby mode, a Journal app, and significant enhancements to Messages. To find out if your iPhone is compatible with iOS 17, there's an easy way to check. Open your Settings app, go to General, and then tap on About. You'll see the Model Name, which will tell you what iPhone version you have. If you're eager to test out iOS 17, you can access the public beta version now. Additionally, you can explore our list of the best iPhones to see if there's a newer model that suits your needs. 
Here's a list of iPhones that will be able to run iOS 17 once it's released later this year, as confirmed by Apple: --iPhone XS 
--iPhone XS Max 
--iPhone XR 
--iPhone 11 
--iPhone 11 Pro 
--iPhone 11 Pro Max 
--iPhone 12 
--iPhone 12 Mini 
--iPhone 12 Pro

--iPhone 13 
--iPhone 13 Mini 
--iPhone 13 Pro

--iPhone SE (second generation and later) 
--iPhone 14 (including Plus) 
--iPhone 14 Pro If your iPhone model isn't listed above, it won't be compatible with iOS 17, and you won't receive a notification to update to the new software. For example, if you own an iPhone X or an older version, the latest software you can use on that phone is iOS 16. So, if you're looking forward to the new features of iOS 17, it might be a good time to consider upgrading to a more recent iPhone model. Along with the iOS 17,  Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 15 range at an event in September 2023. The iPhone 15 lineup is rumored to consist of four models: the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are expected to have 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are expected to have 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch OLED displays with ProMotion technology. All four models are expected to be powered by the A17 Bionic chip. 
In addition to the iPhone 15, Apple is also rumored to launch new Apple Watches and AirPods at its September event. The new Apple Watch Series 9 is expected to have a faster processor and a new design, while the new AirPods Pro 2 are expected to have improved sound quality and active noise cancellation."

"Samsung now allows iOS users to create fake Galaxy Fold with two iPhones, here is how ",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/samsung-try-galaxy-app-222220-16x9.jpg?VersionId=i2O5VYJfzcvqVCJdLJPNvb4.ZH1gyIl_&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Samsung is known for its playful rivalry with Apple, and the company never misses an opportunity to mock its Cupertino-based rival. Whether it's the 100x zoom of the Galaxy S23 Ultra or the reign of its flip and foldable phones, Samsung is always quick to point out Apple's lack of innovation. In short, Samsung is always up to show iOS users the good of Android and draw them to the ""Flip side."" The company's latest move is no different. Samsung recently released its new generation of flip and foldable phones, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Fold 5. And just like clockwork, the company has started teasing Apple users about what they're missing out on. But this time it's not just the advertisement and photos but Samsung is offering a free trial of what it looks like to be a Galaxy user. To be more precise, Samsung is offering a virtual try out of Galaxy UI in iPhones with its app ""Try Galaxy"".  Through Samsung's Try Galaxy app, iPhone users can feel what Galaxy phone offers. The app was originally released in 2020, but it has recently been updated to allow iPhone users to slap two iPhones together to create a ""fake"" Galaxy Fold.  In terms of how the app works, it essentially starts a simulation of the Galaxy phone on the iPhone. Once started, the virtual Galaxy Fold, created using iPhones - requiring the use of two iPhones simultaneously to operate the two screens - will operate in a manner similar to the Galaxy Fold 5. You can open and close apps within the simulation, and you can even utilize the apps that come preinstalled on the phone within Samsung's UI. Furthermore, the update also incorporates app support for up to 20 languages, encompassing Korean, Czech, Hungarian, Latin American Spanish, and Russian. To use the Samsung Galaxy ""Try Galaxy"" app: 
- Visit trygalaxy.com/ 
- Add the app to your iPhone's home screen. 
- Launch the app and tap on ""Try Fold."" 
- Simultaneously repeat the same process on your second iPhone. 
- The two iPhones will be connected using an in-app code. 
- Once set up, both iPhones will combine into one screen, providing a glimpse of the Samsung Fold phone experience. The Try Galaxy app does more than just let users experience the size and aspect ratio of a Galaxy phone. When the app is in use, it also displays One UI 5.1.1, giving iOS users a taste of what Galaxy users see every day. This includes features like Quick Share and Samsung Health's fitness suite. The app even has an ""experience"" that lets users explore the Galaxy Z Flip and Fold's FlexCam mode, which takes advantage of the inner and outer displays. This is something that is not possible on the iPhone lineup.

"Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi once tried delivering food, but struggled with finding addresses",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/uber-020449-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=G4Crr4GAEy1kwBSKzI1WHCSs9xNTr86h&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Getting a firsthand taste of life on the other side, Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, took on the role of a delivery driver to gain insights into the challenges faced by those who work for his company. This experience shed light on the complexities of being an Uber driver, especially when it comes to food delivery. In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Khosrowshahi revealed his struggles with delivering food rather than transporting riders. He recounted a particular incident where he found it perplexing to locate the drop-off point for a food order. Navigating through intricate apartment complexes turned out to be a daunting task, highlighting one of the major challenges faced by delivery drivers. Uber has been working to tackle this issue by providing more precise drop-off pins to users. Despite the difficulties, Khosrowshahi's experience wasn't entirely negative. He shared an amusing anecdote about delivering food to a touch football game. Instead of a building, he found himself on a field surrounded by a group of people playing the game. Moments like these revealed the diverse scenarios that drivers encounter during their shifts. Khosrowshahi emphasized the importance of understanding the challenges faced by Uber drivers. He believes that fostering better working conditions starts with corporate employees immersing themselves in the driver experience and gaining firsthand knowledge of the job. This approach aligns with his previous move to become an Uber driver himself in September, aiming to grasp the reasons behind a slowdown in driver recruitment. During his stint as an Uber driver, Khosrowshahi unveiled several surprising aspects of the job. Delivering food on an electric bike brought attention to the practice of ""tip-baiting,"" where customers initially promise substantial tips but later reduce them post-delivery. This practice, drivers argue, affects their ability to earn a fair wage. Additionally, driving riders to their destinations exposed him to a range of experiences, from passengers sharing personal problems to discussing confidential corporate matters. The challenges faced by Uber drivers aren't limited to just the nature of the job. Passengers have been known to be disruptive, causing disturbances, leaving behind messes, and being tardy. In response to concerns about driver compensation, some local governments have taken steps to address the issue. New York City recently passed a law requiring delivery drivers to earn a minimum of $18 per hour, while Minneapolis is considering a bill to raise the pay of rideshare drivers. Khosrowshahi's venture into the driver's world highlighted the multifaceted challenges these workers encounter. However, even as he confronted the difficulties faced by drivers, he was taken aback by a different perspective as a passenger. A short Uber ride in New York City turned out to be much more expensive than expected, showing that the intricacies of the ride-sharing world can surprise even those at the top."
"IBM CEO says ChatGPT-like AI models will impact white collar work, make companies more productive",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/ibm-221921-16x9.jpg?VersionId=YZJV3fNGUsbJ.U0237d66CeTRI5ugllR&size=690:388,"Listen to Story IBM's chairperson and CEO, Arvind Krishna, has stated that generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, including ChatGPT and Google Bard, can enhance productivity, although they might impact ""back office, white-collar"" work. In an interview with CNBC, Krishna also pointed out the declining or stable population growth in developed countries and expressed that AI technologies could ensure a ""quality life."" These remarks from the IBM CEO come amid the American tech giant's renewed efforts to capitalise on the AI boom. Recently, IBM introduced WatsonX - a suite of generative AI platforms designed to assist enterprises in safely harnessing this technology. During the interview, Krishna also stated that AI models, like ChatGPT, can help with productivity with fewer employees. He said, ""That means you can get the same work done with fewer people. That's just the nature of productivity. I actually believe that the first set of roles that will get impacted are — what I call — back office, white-collar work.""  The IBM CEO was mainly referring to the job trends in developed economies. He suggests there is ""a disinflation in the demographics,"" leading to a decline in the size of the working-age population. He was also clarifying his old remarks about IBM's evolving work practices and potential job cuts at the company.   In a separate interview in May, Krishna said that IBM might replace 30 per cent of jobs with AI or some form of automation technology. As a result, many feared that the company would cut 7,800 jobs in the next five years. Clarifying his old statement, Krishna suggested that new technology replace office work, which also happens at IBM. He notes: ""What I said was we are not going to backfill those roles for the next five years. I said, hey, if I dig that we normally churn (jobs) five-six per cent a year, over five years, that's about 30 per cent of those roles will not need to get backfilled. Labour or AI bots augmenting and working alongside their fellow humans doing that work. So, that is where the 7800 came from. Similar remarks have come from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google chief Sundar Pichai. Both CEOs have stated that AI would serve as an enabler and eliminate mundane tasks. However, some tech experts also expressed concerns that AI technology, particularly freely accessible chatbots like ChatGPT, might lead to unintended consequences, including racial bias. The pioneers of this technology, including OpenAI - the creator of ChatGPT, believe that a certain level of government regulation is crucial."

The singers are currently seeking new management, according to a report by Billboard, following their recent departure from manager Scooter Braun. Demi Lovato had been associated with Braun and his SB Projects company since 2019 before she was managed by Phil McIntyre of PhilyMack.  Though Lovato desired a new direction, she expressed gratitude for her time with SB Projects. At present, Lovato has not finalised any new management, but she is exploring potential options.  Under Braun's management, Lovato released two albums – her 2021 Dancing with the Devilâæ the Art of Starting Over, which reached the No. 2 spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the second, 2020's pop-punk album Holy Fvck, which peaked at No. 7 on the same chart.  Lovato has achieved significant success in her career, with 36 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 since 2008, including four top 10 hits. Furthermore, all eight of her studio albums have debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard 200, with 2009's Here We Go Again even reaching No. 1. Fans of Lovato are looking forward to her upcoming release, Demi Lovato Revamped, set to come out on September 15. This album features rock versions of her biggest hits, including Heart Attack, Sorry Not Sorry featuring Slash, Cool For the Summer, and more. Ariana Grande has also parted ways with her longtime manager Scooter Braun, as reported by Puck News on Monday.  Grande had been with Braun and his SB Projects since 2013 when she released her debut album, Yours Truly. She had previously praised Braun as an incredible businessman who was passionate about her project in a 2013 interview with Elle. Grande briefly fired Braun in 2016, which he attributed to ""s—-y boyfriends."" In a 2018 interview with Variety, Braun revealed that he had waited for Grande to come back to him, and when she did, they had an honest conversation. Their relationship was further solidified when Braun assisted Grande in organising a benefit concert in Manchester following the 2017 terrorist attack at her show. SB Project's artist roster still includes Justin Bieber, a longstanding client of Braun's.  It is important to note that in 2021, Braun sold SB Projects' parent company, Ithaca Holdings, to the South Korean entertainment giant HYBE. Despite the sale, SB Projects continues to operate under HYBE, with Braun assuming the role of HYBE America's CEO.  Earlier this year, Braun assisted HYBE in acquiring the leading hip-hop label Quality Control."

She also wrote, ""Lovers find secret places inside this violent world where they make transactions with beauty.' All poetry above by Rumi,"" quoting another poem by Rumi.  The pictures show the couple's beautiful chemistry from their wedding festivities. In the first image, Khrisha is seen laughing while Anmol looks at her with love. Another picture shows a beautiful moment between the couple from their wedding ceremony. While Anmol carries Khrisha in one of the images, the couple enjoys a hearty moment from their post-wedding ceremony in another. Anmol Ambani is the elder son of industrialist Anil Ambani and Tina Ambani. Khrisha Shah, on the other hand, is the CEO and co-founder of Dysco, a social networking website.  Anmol and Khrisha got married on February 20, 2022, in Mumbai.  The couple's wedding took place at Anil Ambani's home, Sea Wind, at Cuffe Parade in Mumbai and was attended by many celebrities. Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shweta Bachchan Nanda, Rima Jain, and fashion designer Sandeep Khosla, among others, were a part of the celebrations."

"Big on safety, Uber India says users can cancel rides even after cab arrives",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/uber-225357-16x9.jpg?VersionId=RCyRTBKfCRy8h8ce0exvqyhq4PDXCHo0&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Uber charges a cancellation fee from users whenever they cancel the ride after the driver has reached the location. While the reason for cancellation can be any, the company justifies the fees as a way to pay drivers for the time and effort they spend getting to the location. While this is something that we all, or at the least all of us who use Uber know, this is not entirely accurate. Uber India, with its big focus on safety, says that riders can cancel a ride for free even at the last minute under certain circumstances.  And all of that is because Uber wants riders to safe and has a safety-first approach. Or so says Mansi Chadha, Uber's customer experience director for India and South Asia. In an exclusive interview with India Today Tech, Manasi says that if the customer is not feeling safe after seeing and meeting the driver and the designated car, they are free to cancel the ride.  ""Safety is at the heart of everything we do at UberâæIf you think you are not feeling safeâæ in cases where the ride is not as per the safety standards then users should cancel their trip even if it has arrived (at the pick up point),"" she said. In this instance, the user is still charged a cancellation fee. But if the user raises an immediate request for its refund, and cite safety as the reason for it, the cancellation charge is immediately reversed.  ""Cancellation fee is charged to compensate drivers, but if there are safety concerns, riders should cancel the ride without even thinking about it,"" she says. ""Also, simultaneously users should raise the issues to the Uber 24/7 Safety line so that the safety team can look into the matter and the cancellation fee is waived off."" So, what are these circumstances where you can safely - and without paying a penalty - cancel an Uber ride after the cab has reached your pickup point? The following ones, as corroborated by Sooraj Nair, who is Uber Head of Safety Operations for Uber India and South Asia.  Uber has a slew of safety features, including real-time ID check, round-the-clock customer support, and an SOS feature. However, all of these features are only available for online trips. So, if your driver asks you to take the ride offline by cancelling the trip on the app, Uber considers this a red flag. ""We are committed to the safety of our rides, and offer all of these features until the trip is online,"" said Sooraj. So, if a ride goes offline, Uber will not be able to track your ride, and the company will not be responsible for your safety. And in case a driver asks you to take the ride offline, Uber India recommends that you cancel the ride and book a fresh cab.  The second instance where the safety of an Uber rider can be at risk is when the vehicle details do not match the information added in the app. This too is considered a security risk by Uber.  Or maybe when you look at the driver who has arrived to pick you up, you see that the face doesn't match what the app is showing you. In this case, Uber India recommends that you cancel the ride due to safety considerations.  When you book an Uber ride, Uber will set your payment method based on your preference. If the driver refuses to accept the fare through the set payment method - for example many drivers say, ""give me cash"" - and insists on an alternate mode of payment, this is a breach of Uber's policy. This is another safety red flag and Uber recommends cancellation.  As mentioned earlier, the fare for your Uber ride is determined by the app based on distance, time, and other factors. So if the driver demands more money than the calculated fare, it's a clear violation of the company's policy. Uber discourages any unauthorised charges or fare negotiations outside the app and asks riders to cancel the ride if faced with such a situation. This is new and a much welcome move by Uber. The company has made it mandatory for drivers to keep a functional rear seatbelt. So if you enter the vehicle and notice that the rear seatbelts are not functional or missing, it's considered a safety concern and riders can cancel the ride.  The similar measure is applicable for the Moto rides, where drivers are supposed to provide a helmet to the pillion rider.  How Uber ride cancellation and refund works  According to Uber, the cancellation fee will be charged irrespective of the safety concerns if you are cancelling a ride after the drives has reached the pickup point. But in case of safety-related cancellation, you can ask Uber to refund the fee. This you can do by:   After cancellation of the trip, go to 'Trips' on the Uber app  Click on the cancelled trip and see the amount charged as a cancellation fee. Tap on the 'Get trip help?' option  Tap on 'Dispute my cancellation fee' from the given options.  Now select 'Review my cancellation fee' and submit.  You will see a list of reasons for cancellation. Select your reason and submit. Uber notes that in all scenarios described, you can review the cancellation fee and get it refunded. In most cases, the refund is instantaneous."

"iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/iqoo-neo-7-pro-222404-16x9.png?VersionId=Pez8M0R2zkYytpMZoLPZnA2tT9cII48Q&size=690:388,"Listen to Story The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G is probably one of those rare offerings in the sub-Rs 35,000 price segment, which not only promises flagship-grade performance but also delivers it. Of course, this is courtesy of the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip under the hood, which also makes it one of the most affordable phones to be powered by Snapdragon’s last year flagship processor. But, is this enough of a reason to warrant a purchase? Well, actually, there are 4 of them.  If you are on the lookout for a high-performing smartphone on a budget of around Rs 35,000, in this article, we give you 4 reasons why you should consider purchasing the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G and 1 reason why it won’t be your cup of tea. Read on.   iQOO has been boasting about the performance chops of the Neo 7 Pro 5G and so, it is quite apparent that the first reason has to be the phone’s performance. Personally, I have used a bunch of phones around Rs 35,000  that offer commendable performance, like the Nothing Phone (1), Redmi Note 12 Pro+, and most recently, the OnePlus Nord 3. If we take it up a notch, for about Rs 40,000, I have also used the OnePlus 11R. And trust me, as good as the OnePlus 11R is, the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G is, in my books, a better phone, both in terms of price and performance. You see, the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G has been a charmer when it comes to delivering a great performance with great thermals. Of course, handling ordinary tasks is a piece of cake for this phone, but where the Neo 7 Pro 5G really shines is with heavy lifting. Personally, I have used this phone for watching a lot of videos and playing games, and without a shadow of a doubt, the Neo 7 Pro 5G delivers through and through.   The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G offers great performance, but to take advantage of that great performance, you need to have a great display. And the Neo 7 Pro’s 6.78” FHD+ flat AMOLED display, with 10-Bit colours and a 120Hz refresh rate, is one of the best and brightest panels that you get in this price range. One, it is amazing for video playback, with support for HDR10 on YouTube and OTT. Additionally, taps and touches are precise and accurate while gaming, thanks to the 1200Hz touch response rate. Personally, I watched a lot of Netflix on the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G and one time, I watched the entire season of Lookism, an anime, at a stretch, and the experience was good. Plus, the stereo speaker setup on offer sounds good. For listening to music, again, there’s a good amount of depth and I found the overall loudness and clarity to be just fine.  The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G features three cameras at the rear and, of course, the star of the show here is the 50MP primary rear camera with OIS. And while I am sure many of you who must be interested in this smartphone, will be because of its performance chops, trust me when I say this — the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G has been a pleasant surprise when it comes to the camera performance. In a nutshell, I found the iQOO Neo 7 Pro’s rear camera to be quite reliable. The shots captured look just the right amount of vibrant. HDR performance is top-notch. And overall, in good lighting, the 50MP primary camera gives you superb performance for a phone at this price point. The phone also captures some well-detailed selfies. Yes, the portrait mode shots could use slight tuning with edge detection, but overall, selfies taken during the day or night turn out just fine.  The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G has a relatively large 5,000mAh battery with support for superfast 120W charging. Based on my usage, which involves a lot of video calls, texting, watching YouTube and playing Call of Duty for at least an hour daily, I was easily able to hit a day’s worth of endurance, with at least 30% battery left by the time I went to bed, on a consistent basis. Of course, whenever there’s a need for a top-up, trust me, the maximum I have had the phone hooked to the charger has been for just 20 minutes.  Software-wise, the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G boots Funtouch OS 13 atop Android 13, and while I did have my reservations that maybe this would be one area where the phone might disappoint, the good news is, it did not. That said, while Funtouch OS 13 offers improved personalisation options, enhanced privacy and security features, and other useful features for a smooth and seamless experience, the 2 years of Android OS upgrades + 3 years of security patch updates is the only bummer when it comes to future support. Because, while 2 years of software support was the standard until last year, other brands such as OnePlus are offering 3 years of OS upgrades, and Samsung, on the other hand, is promising 4 years of Android OS upgrades for most of its phones. So, this is one area where iQOO could’ve surely done better. "

"IIT Madras, UAE develop innovative cooling solution for electronics applications",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/iit-madras-221038-16x9.jpg?VersionId=xwIOf9Bxi2tgu.VQ8g4ZjFxTMyyplOtS&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) and Khalifa University, UAE, have made significant strides in advancing heat management for miniature electronic devices, particularly for space applications. The researchers’ latest breakthrough in mini-channel heat exchangers has been published in the reputed peer-reviewed journal Applied Thermal Engineering (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121064). The research paper was co-authored by Professor S Vengadesan, Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras and his Research student, R. Vishnu, along with Dr Ahmed Alkaabi and Dr Deepak Selvakumar from Khalifa University. India's second Space Age has been driven by impressive technological innovations and the miniaturisation of electronic components, enabling advanced functionalities, exemplified by the ongoing Chandrayaan-3 mission. However, the extensive use of miniaturised electronic components, both in space missions and consumer electronics, leads to significant heat generation. High-performance computing processors can generate up to 200-250 W or more of power, resulting in heat loads of up to 1 kW, necessitating efficient heat management. Liquid-cooling systems, especially micro/mini-channel heat sinks, are considered best suited for dissipating heat in such systems. The research conducted by the IIT Madras team aims to disrupt the smooth flow inside the mini-channels through the use of plate electrodes. Elaborating on the significance of this research, Professor S. Vengadesan, Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras, said, “The new design developed by this research team uses thin plate electrodes that introduce swirling flows inside mini-channel fluids, which result in the formation of vortices at the boundaries, which in turn facilitates better heat transfer."" To validate the design, the researchers employed computational methods that simulate fluid flows in three dimensions. Through these simulations, they observed how the chaotic swirling flows effectively disrupted the smooth flow at the walls of the channels, and thereby enhanced heat transfer. The electrodes induce vortices at the boundary layer due to the Onsager-Wien effect and disrupt the smooth flow. The use of a weak electric field to induce swirling flow in minichannels renders the application operationally safe and low power-consuming. The study's applications in electronic thermal management, particularly in space technology, are vast. Additionally, the electrically driven flow vortices generated by this design eliminate the need for additional geometrical modifications. With no moving parts, this design operates without vibration and requires no maintenance. Furthermore, its electrically operated nature ensures intelligent control and quick response. 
 
 The team plans to optimise the design by considering different electrode positions and orientations. Additionally, the mechanism identified in this study holds great promise for enhancing thin-film boiling and the team proposes to extend the application of the design to two-phase heat transfer systems.

This development was announced during a meeting he had with various vice-chancellors and officials of the Higher Education department at Vidhana Soudha. Siddaramaiah opined that the education imparted at universities should not be influenced by any form of social bias such as caste, religion, or language. He reassured that any activities against the principles of the Indian Constitution should be abstained from, particularly within universities. ""If students emerge from universities ignorant and rigidly holding onto their caste affiliations, then what they have received cannot truly be regarded as an education,"" the CM was quoted as saying. Siddaramaiah firmly stated that university-based learning should hold a torch to rationality and scientific thinking, as opposed to being conservative or being inclined towards particular faiths. He also mentioned that certain university-hosted meetings and ceremonies he attended did nothing but undermine the contributions of freedom fighters, constitution writers, and social thinkers. ""Anti-secular thinking should not be rewarded within higher education settings as it could potentially influence students' impartiality,"" the CM cautioned. He advised against organising such programmes, suggesting that a wholesome society can only be obtained if higher education takes the correct track. Siddaramaiah also proposed that the ""fruits of research"" produced by universities should not be confined to their libraries. Instead, he urged that it should be relevant and widely disseminated in society, thereby benefiting the people at large.

Hailing from Agra's Rami Gadi village in Etmadpur tehsil, Divya's pursuit of success was shaped by her tenacity and the unwavering support of her mother, who despite being unable to complete her studies herself, made sure no stone was left unturned for her daughter to go all the way. This was Divya’s third attempt at the prestigious exam. Last time, she couldn't crack the exam just for two marks, but this year, she found her name right at the top of the list of deputy collectors (sub-divisional magistrates).

Coming from a well-grounded family background which comprises of her grandmother, parents, and two brothers, one of which is preparing for the UPSC prelims, Divya learned the importance of diligence and perseverance at an early age. Her father, a retired BSF official, and her family's main pillar of support, is now engaged in farming. However, victory does not come easy. The civil services examination is a challenging journey that demands patience and dedication.

During challenging periods, I derived motivation and encouragement from my family, friends, and mentors, which helped me focus on my end goal,” she adds. Divya acknowledges that the Covid-19 pandemic posed unique problems, especially in buying study materials. Undeterred, she navigated these challenges with the support of her family and friends, remaining firmly rooted to her end goal. Recognising the significance of balance, Divya indulged in a range of calming activities to maintain healthy stress levels. “Firstly, I made sure to exercise regularly as it is known to reduce stress levels effectively. A simple walk or jog was enough to help me unwind and reduce anxiety,” she says. “I pursued hobbies that I enjoyed, such as reading or listening to music. Engaging in a hobby helped me take my mind off the exam and reduce stress,” Divya adds. She also spent quality time with her friends and family to keep her mind stress-free. Fuelled by a keen interest in civil services that sprouted during her graduation years, Sikarwar was eager to do something for the country. “I am eager to work with complete dedication towards the development of society through civil services,” she says. Divya shares that each aspirant should find their unique motivation and harness it as a driving force, alongside covering the syllabus entirely and thoroughly. In her words, ""Believing in oneself is essential for success"".  “I advise students to cover the entire syllabus and revise it thoroughly multiple times. It is important to regularly assess your preparation through various test series to identify areas that require more attention and improvement,” she says. “In addition, seeking the support and guidance of parents and friends can also provide invaluable encouragement and motivation,” she adds.

Anand, speaking exclusively to India Today, suggested that Praggnanandhaa missed an opportunity to put Carlsen under pressure with the white pieces and that the young Indian should brace for an aggressive game from the World No. 1, who will be playing whites in the second classical game of the Chess World Cup final on Wednesday.  However, Anand backed Praggnanandhaa's fighting skills, lauding the youngster for his incredible run to the final. ""It's a great moment for Indian chess. It's a great moment for Pragg. Just to give you an idea, I have won two World Cups. Pragg will be the first Indian to play in a World Cup final after I played. But by strange coincidence, that's the one gap in Carlsen's tournament record. He has never won a World Cup. He reached the World cup final for the first time. They are both playing for a win for the first time, which is curious,"" Viswanathan Anand said.  Praggnanandhaa R about tomorrow's second game against Carlsen: ""It'll be a fight. He'll definitely push very hard. I'll try to rest and come fresh, I think that's the best I can do.""    
— International Chess Federation (@FIDE_chess)  Anand, who won the World Cup in 2000 and 2002, highlighted Praggnanandhaa's victories over World No. 3 Fabiano Caruana and and World No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura, saying the youngster's ability to compete with the best at such a young age sets him for a great future.  Anand said Praggnanandhaa has the ability to get out of difficult positions, consistently and it makes him a difficult opponent to deal with, especially in knockout games in tournaments like the World Cup.  ""He is a huge talent. At such a young age, he has shown that he has what it takes to go all the way. He has all the qualities you need, tenacity, ability to keep playing under pressure. He has huge competitive skills as well. He is not only about knowledge, he competes at a very high level as well. People are so excited about him. ""It's a combination of tenacity. He consistently saves difficult positions which means that it's not just enough to get into good positions against him. You have to knock him out. It's a very useful quality because the harder it is for the opponent to knock you out, the more discouraged they become. He has been able to do it against the strongest players. He did that against the No. 2. He was in a difficult spot but one good chance and he went for it. ""He is able to play against players like Carlsen who put pressure on you during all phases of the game. To be able to absorb that and give it back and keep making good moves is wonderful. It's his composure and It's a combination of good nerves, fitness, and sensible decision-making that is making him play good chess,"" he added.  Praggnanandhaa demonstrated his exceptional skills and strategic acumen. He defeated the world number three, Fabiano Caruana, in the semi-finals, making him the first Indian since Viswanathan Anand in 2002 to reach the final of the FIDE World Cup. This victory was particularly impressive as Caruana was five points ahead of the world number three, marking a significant achievement for the young Indian Grandmaster.
