Rayudu became only the second Indian cricketer after Pravin Tambe to feature in the men's CPL. After retiring from IPL and domestic cricket following Chennai Super Kings's triumphant run in 2023, Rayudu  , CSK's sister franchise, for the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA. But due to personal reasons, Rayudu decided to withdraw from the MLC, despite being one of the key signings for the Texas Super Kings. His decision came amidst speculations about a proposed cooling-off period policy by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which could potentially restrict retired players from participating in overseas leagues immediately after their retirement. Rayudu eventually made his CPL debut for St Kitts & Nevis Patriots on August 19 against Trinbago Knight RIders. However, Rayudu did not get an opportunity to bat as the match was affected by rain.  “I have heard some really good things about the league, especially the standard of cricket that’s played here.  I am happy to be part of the St. Kitts & Nevis Patriots,” Rayudu said.  Shedding light on his decision to play in the CPL, Rayudu said he had heard a lot of good things about the T20 league from Kieron Pollard and his former CSK teammate Dwayne Bravo.  “Pollard and Bravo used to talk a lot about the CPL. This is the first time I’m playing in a dressing room without any Indians, so that’s a bit strange and it feels a bit different but they’re really nice people. They have been very warm. “Playing in the CPL is a very different experience as compared to playing in India. They have a lot of music and a lot of fun, it’s all a bit new to me but I’m really enjoying it so far.”"

A speeding truck lost control and hit a tractor before ramming into a moving goods train on the Farakka bridge in West Bengal on Tuesday morning. The 14-wheeler lorry, en route from Malda to Farakka, was hurtling down the bridge at an alarming speed when it slammed into a tractor that was heading in the opposite direction. Struggling to regain control, the lorry careened across the bridge, breaking through the bridge's railing due to its uncontrollable velocity. With its path unobstructed, the lorry then crashed directly into the path of a goods vehicle that was moving along the down rail line, bound for its destination. The cargo train's driver prevented an even greater catastrophe by applying the emergency brakes. Police and railway officials soon reached the spot.

"Realme GT 5 to let you adjust CPU clock speed: What this means, why should you care",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/realme-12-projpg-015435-16x9.jpg?VersionId=ocTeEobr1DaoC6p7KLdPWRxjgNeUxmu8&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Realme has confirmed its plans to launch the Realme GT 5 smartphone, and it's shaping up to be an exciting addition to the market, particularly due to its use of a unique feature that hasn't been officially introduced on other smartphones. The premium 5G phone will be using Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset and will offer an option to directly adjust the CPU clock speed. But, what does this mean, and why should consumers care? Let's find out. In an announcement on Weibo, the tech company revealed that the Realme GT 5 will come equipped with a ""geek performance panel."" While the details are still somewhat scarce, this panel will grant users the ability to fine-tune the clock speed of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 CPU, a functionality not yet seen in mainstream smartphones.  Screenshots of this intriguing feature, shared by known leaker Digital Chat Station, hint at a granular level of control. Users will have the ability to independently adjust the clock speeds of the high-performance, mid-range, and low-power CPU cores. It is unknown whether the company will let people make changes on a per-app basis, but this option would prove to be very useful if the company does add support. Realme is also expected to provide an option to revert to default settings in case users get confused and go in the wrong direction. This marks a potentially groundbreaking development, as traditionally, such CPU clock speed adjustments needed root access and select third-party apps, as first reported by . Adjusting CPU clock speed enables users to tailor their device's performance to their specific needs. For resource-intensive tasks like gaming or video editing, you can increase the clock speed to boost performance, resulting in smoother gameplay and faster video rendering. Conversely, for everyday tasks like browsing or reading emails, you can reduce the clock speed to save battery life and reduce heat generation. The ability to adjust a phone's CPU clock speed allows users to optimize their device's performance, battery life, and heat generation according to their specific preferences and needs. It remains to be seen how this feature will work and whether this will become a trend among premium phones in the near future. The official launch of the Realme GT 5 is scheduled for August 28 in China, with global availability details yet to be disclosed. But, since Realme brings almost most of its 5G phones to the Indian market, we expect the company to announce the new offering under the GT series in this country too. So far, there are no details on when this would arrive. "

"IBM CEO says ChatGPT-like AI models will impact white collar work, make companies more productive",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/ibm-221921-16x9.jpg?VersionId=YZJV3fNGUsbJ.U0237d66CeTRI5ugllR&size=690:388,"Listen to Story IBM's chairperson and CEO, Arvind Krishna, has stated that generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, including ChatGPT and Google Bard, can enhance productivity, although they might impact ""back office, white-collar"" work. In an interview with CNBC, Krishna also pointed out the declining or stable population growth in developed countries and expressed that AI technologies could ensure a ""quality life."" These remarks from the IBM CEO come amid the American tech giant's renewed efforts to capitalise on the AI boom. Recently, IBM introduced WatsonX - a suite of generative AI platforms designed to assist enterprises in safely harnessing this technology. During the interview, Krishna also stated that AI models, like ChatGPT, can help with productivity with fewer employees. He said, ""That means you can get the same work done with fewer people. That's just the nature of productivity. I actually believe that the first set of roles that will get impacted are — what I call — back office, white-collar work.""  The IBM CEO was mainly referring to the job trends in developed economies. He suggests there is ""a disinflation in the demographics,"" leading to a decline in the size of the working-age population. He was also clarifying his old remarks about IBM's evolving work practices and potential job cuts at the company.   In a separate interview in May, Krishna said that IBM might replace 30 per cent of jobs with AI or some form of automation technology. As a result, many feared that the company would cut 7,800 jobs in the next five years. Clarifying his old statement, Krishna suggested that new technology replace office work, which also happens at IBM. He notes: ""What I said was we are not going to backfill those roles for the next five years. I said, hey, if I dig that we normally churn (jobs) five-six per cent a year, over five years, that's about 30 per cent of those roles will not need to get backfilled. Labour or AI bots augmenting and working alongside their fellow humans doing that work. So, that is where the 7800 came from. Similar remarks have come from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google chief Sundar Pichai. Both CEOs have stated that AI would serve as an enabler and eliminate mundane tasks. However, some tech experts also expressed concerns that AI technology, particularly freely accessible chatbots like ChatGPT, might lead to unintended consequences, including racial bias. The pioneers of this technology, including OpenAI - the creator of ChatGPT, believe that a certain level of government regulation is crucial."

The app was originally released in 2020, but it has recently been updated to allow iPhone users to slap two iPhones together to create a ""fake"" Galaxy Fold.  In terms of how the app works, it essentially starts a simulation of the Galaxy phone on the iPhone. Once started, the virtual Galaxy Fold, created using iPhones - requiring the use of two iPhones simultaneously to operate the two screens - will operate in a manner similar to the Galaxy Fold 5. You can open and close apps within the simulation, and you can even utilize the apps that come preinstalled on the phone within Samsung's UI. Furthermore, the update also incorporates app support for up to 20 languages, encompassing Korean, Czech, Hungarian, Latin American Spanish, and Russian. To use the Samsung Galaxy ""Try Galaxy"" app: 
- Visit trygalaxy.com/ 
- Add the app to your iPhone's home screen. 
- Launch the app and tap on ""Try Fold."" 
- Simultaneously repeat the same process on your second iPhone. 
- The two iPhones will be connected using an in-app code. 
- Once set up, both iPhones will combine into one screen, providing a glimpse of the Samsung Fold phone experience. The Try Galaxy app does more than just let users experience the size and aspect ratio of a Galaxy phone. When the app is in use, it also displays One UI 5.1.1, giving iOS users a taste of what Galaxy users see every day. This includes features like Quick Share and Samsung Health's fitness suite. The app even has an ""experience"" that lets users explore the Galaxy Z Flip and Fold's FlexCam mode, which takes advantage of the inner and outer displays. This is something that is not possible on the iPhone lineup.

The singers are currently seeking new management, according to a report by Billboard, following their recent departure from manager Scooter Braun. Demi Lovato had been associated with Braun and his SB Projects company since 2019 before she was managed by Phil McIntyre of PhilyMack.  Though Lovato desired a new direction, she expressed gratitude for her time with SB Projects. At present, Lovato has not finalised any new management, but she is exploring potential options.  Under Braun's management, Lovato released two albums – her 2021 Dancing with the Devilâæ the Art of Starting Over, which reached the No. 2 spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the second, 2020's pop-punk album Holy Fvck, which peaked at No. 7 on the same chart.  Lovato has achieved significant success in her career, with 36 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 since 2008, including four top 10 hits. Furthermore, all eight of her studio albums have debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard 200, with 2009's Here We Go Again even reaching No. 1. Fans of Lovato are looking forward to her upcoming release, Demi Lovato Revamped, set to come out on September 15. This album features rock versions of her biggest hits, including Heart Attack, Sorry Not Sorry featuring Slash, Cool For the Summer, and more. Ariana Grande has also parted ways with her longtime manager Scooter Braun, as reported by Puck News on Monday.  Grande had been with Braun and his SB Projects since 2013 when she released her debut album, Yours Truly. She had previously praised Braun as an incredible businessman who was passionate about her project in a 2013 interview with Elle. Grande briefly fired Braun in 2016, which he attributed to ""s—-y boyfriends."" In a 2018 interview with Variety, Braun revealed that he had waited for Grande to come back to him, and when she did, they had an honest conversation. Their relationship was further solidified when Braun assisted Grande in organising a benefit concert in Manchester following the 2017 terrorist attack at her show. SB Project's artist roster still includes Justin Bieber, a longstanding client of Braun's.  It is important to note that in 2021, Braun sold SB Projects' parent company, Ithaca Holdings, to the South Korean entertainment giant HYBE. Despite the sale, SB Projects continues to operate under HYBE, with Braun assuming the role of HYBE America's CEO.  Earlier this year, Braun assisted HYBE in acquiring the leading hip-hop label Quality Control."

"Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi once tried delivering food, but struggled with finding addresses",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/uber-020449-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=G4Crr4GAEy1kwBSKzI1WHCSs9xNTr86h&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Getting a firsthand taste of life on the other side, Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, took on the role of a delivery driver to gain insights into the challenges faced by those who work for his company. This experience shed light on the complexities of being an Uber driver, especially when it comes to food delivery. In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Khosrowshahi revealed his struggles with delivering food rather than transporting riders. He recounted a particular incident where he found it perplexing to locate the drop-off point for a food order. Navigating through intricate apartment complexes turned out to be a daunting task, highlighting one of the major challenges faced by delivery drivers. Uber has been working to tackle this issue by providing more precise drop-off pins to users. Despite the difficulties, Khosrowshahi's experience wasn't entirely negative. He shared an amusing anecdote about delivering food to a touch football game. Instead of a building, he found himself on a field surrounded by a group of people playing the game. Moments like these revealed the diverse scenarios that drivers encounter during their shifts. Khosrowshahi emphasized the importance of understanding the challenges faced by Uber drivers. He believes that fostering better working conditions starts with corporate employees immersing themselves in the driver experience and gaining firsthand knowledge of the job. This approach aligns with his previous move to become an Uber driver himself in September, aiming to grasp the reasons behind a slowdown in driver recruitment. During his stint as an Uber driver, Khosrowshahi unveiled several surprising aspects of the job. Delivering food on an electric bike brought attention to the practice of ""tip-baiting,"" where customers initially promise substantial tips but later reduce them post-delivery. This practice, drivers argue, affects their ability to earn a fair wage. Additionally, driving riders to their destinations exposed him to a range of experiences, from passengers sharing personal problems to discussing confidential corporate matters. The challenges faced by Uber drivers aren't limited to just the nature of the job. Passengers have been known to be disruptive, causing disturbances, leaving behind messes, and being tardy. In response to concerns about driver compensation, some local governments have taken steps to address the issue. New York City recently passed a law requiring delivery drivers to earn a minimum of $18 per hour, while Minneapolis is considering a bill to raise the pay of rideshare drivers. Khosrowshahi's venture into the driver's world highlighted the multifaceted challenges these workers encounter. However, even as he confronted the difficulties faced by drivers, he was taken aback by a different perspective as a passenger. A short Uber ride in New York City turned out to be much more expensive than expected, showing that the intricacies of the ride-sharing world can surprise even those at the top."

"IIT Madras, UAE develop innovative cooling solution for electronics applications",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/iit-madras-221038-16x9.jpg?VersionId=xwIOf9Bxi2tgu.VQ8g4ZjFxTMyyplOtS&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) and Khalifa University, UAE, have made significant strides in advancing heat management for miniature electronic devices, particularly for space applications. The researchers’ latest breakthrough in mini-channel heat exchangers has been published in the reputed peer-reviewed journal Applied Thermal Engineering (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121064). The research paper was co-authored by Professor S Vengadesan, Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras and his Research student, R. Vishnu, along with Dr Ahmed Alkaabi and Dr Deepak Selvakumar from Khalifa University. India's second Space Age has been driven by impressive technological innovations and the miniaturisation of electronic components, enabling advanced functionalities, exemplified by the ongoing Chandrayaan-3 mission. However, the extensive use of miniaturised electronic components, both in space missions and consumer electronics, leads to significant heat generation. High-performance computing processors can generate up to 200-250 W or more of power, resulting in heat loads of up to 1 kW, necessitating efficient heat management. Liquid-cooling systems, especially micro/mini-channel heat sinks, are considered best suited for dissipating heat in such systems. The research conducted by the IIT Madras team aims to disrupt the smooth flow inside the mini-channels through the use of plate electrodes. Elaborating on the significance of this research, Professor S. Vengadesan, Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras, said, “The new design developed by this research team uses thin plate electrodes that introduce swirling flows inside mini-channel fluids, which result in the formation of vortices at the boundaries, which in turn facilitates better heat transfer."" To validate the design, the researchers employed computational methods that simulate fluid flows in three dimensions. Through these simulations, they observed how the chaotic swirling flows effectively disrupted the smooth flow at the walls of the channels, and thereby enhanced heat transfer. The electrodes induce vortices at the boundary layer due to the Onsager-Wien effect and disrupt the smooth flow. The use of a weak electric field to induce swirling flow in minichannels renders the application operationally safe and low power-consuming. The study's applications in electronic thermal management, particularly in space technology, are vast. Additionally, the electrically driven flow vortices generated by this design eliminate the need for additional geometrical modifications. With no moving parts, this design operates without vibration and requires no maintenance. Furthermore, its electrically operated nature ensures intelligent control and quick response. 
 
 The team plans to optimise the design by considering different electrode positions and orientations. Additionally, the mechanism identified in this study holds great promise for enhancing thin-film boiling and the team proposes to extend the application of the design to two-phase heat transfer systems.

"Focus on rational thinking, not religious ideologies in higher edu: Karnataka CM",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/institutes-need-to-focus-on-rational-thinking-over-religious-ideas-karnataka-cm-224651-16x9.jpg?VersionId=Kil2LngfRIjZ.ZWJGQ.2f11Fh2PVJ98F&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah stressed on Monday that higher education institutions need to foster scientific and rational thinking amongst students rather than promoting religious ideologies. This development was announced during a meeting he had with various vice-chancellors and officials of the Higher Education department at Vidhana Soudha. Siddaramaiah opined that the education imparted at universities should not be influenced by any form of social bias such as caste, religion, or language. He reassured that any activities against the principles of the Indian Constitution should be abstained from, particularly within universities. ""If students emerge from universities ignorant and rigidly holding onto their caste affiliations, then what they have received cannot truly be regarded as an education,"" the CM was quoted as saying. Siddaramaiah firmly stated that university-based learning should hold a torch to rationality and scientific thinking, as opposed to being conservative or being inclined towards particular faiths. He also mentioned that certain university-hosted meetings and ceremonies he attended did nothing but undermine the contributions of freedom fighters, constitution writers, and social thinkers. ""Anti-secular thinking should not be rewarded within higher education settings as it could potentially influence students' impartiality,"" the CM cautioned. He advised against organising such programmes, suggesting that a wholesome society can only be obtained if higher education takes the correct track. Siddaramaiah also proposed that the ""fruits of research"" produced by universities should not be confined to their libraries. Instead, he urged that it should be relevant and widely disseminated in society, thereby benefiting the people at large.

Hailing from Agra's Rami Gadi village in Etmadpur tehsil, Divya's pursuit of success was shaped by her tenacity and the unwavering support of her mother, who despite being unable to complete her studies herself, made sure no stone was left unturned for her daughter to go all the way. This was Divya’s third attempt at the prestigious exam. Last time, she couldn't crack the exam just for two marks, but this year, she found her name right at the top of the list of deputy collectors (sub-divisional magistrates). Armed with an MSc in statistics from St. John's College, Divya now envisions uplifting girls and women in rural areas through quality education, vocational training and self-group groups for financial stability With her feet firmly rooted in her humble beginnings and eyes set on her future goals, Sikarwar is nothing short of a beacon of inspiration. Coming from a well-grounded family background which comprises of her grandmother, parents, and two brothers, one of which is preparing for the UPSC prelims, Divya learned the importance of diligence and perseverance at an early age. Her father, a retired BSF official, and her family's main pillar of support, is now engaged in farming. However, victory does not come easy. The civil services examination is a challenging journey that demands patience and dedication. Divya followed a robust preparation plan, making use of resources like Unacademy alongside textbooks like 'Political Science' by Lakshmi Kant and NCERT. “It is imperative to recognise the value of self-study and consistent answer writing practice, which are critical components of this exam,” she says. “To ensure I was well-equipped to excel in this exam, I devoted 8-10 hours of daily study to attending classes and engaging in self-study. During challenging periods, I derived motivation and encouragement from my family, friends, and mentors, which helped me focus on my end goal,” she adds. Divya acknowledges that the Covid-19 pandemic posed unique problems, especially in buying study materials. Undeterred, she navigated these challenges with the support of her family and friends, remaining firmly rooted to her end goal. Recognising the significance of balance, Divya indulged in a range of calming activities to maintain healthy stress levels. “Firstly, I made sure to exercise regularly as it is known to reduce stress levels effectively. A simple walk or jog was enough to help me unwind and reduce anxiety,” she says. “I pursued hobbies that I enjoyed, such as reading or listening to music. Engaging in a hobby helped me take my mind off the exam and reduce stress,” Divya adds. She also spent quality time with her friends and family to keep her mind stress-free. Fuelled by a keen interest in civil services that sprouted during her graduation years, Sikarwar was eager to do something for the country. “I am eager to work with complete dedication towards the development of society through civil services,” she says. Divya shares that each aspirant should find their unique motivation and harness it as a driving force, alongside covering the syllabus entirely and thoroughly. In her words, ""Believing in oneself is essential for success"".  “I advise students to cover the entire syllabus and revise it thoroughly multiple times. It is important to regularly assess your preparation through various test series to identify areas that require more attention and improvement,” she says. “In addition, seeking the support and guidance of parents and friends can also provide invaluable encouragement and motivation,” she adds. 
 
 Indeed, with her triumph, Divya Sikarwar has not only secured her career but has also become a symbol of hope and inspiration for countless students striving towards the same goal."

First published in 1943, it consists of 32 short stories that perfectly capture rural life in that era. The Hitopadesh/Hitopadesha is a collection of stories presumably written in the 12th-century. The origins are unknown but the tales are timeless. With its vibrant illustrations and simple narrative, this book is a delightful way to introduce young children to the concept of days of the week, basic counting, and metamorphosis. The story follows the journey of a caterpillar as it transforms into a beautiful butterfly. A soothing bedtime read, ‘Goodnight Moon’ has been a cherished part of many children's night-time routines.

Ready to captain Australia as long as the team needs me: Marsh ,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/mitchell-marsh-070142-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=DRkGaJplKO.f4dx41naY.UfYcykWCXWo&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Mitchell Marsh expressed delight over the positive turn of events for him in 2023, highlighting his return to Test cricket, marriage and then elevation to captain in T20I cricket. The all-rounder, who has been one of the consistent performers for Australia in the recent past, said he is willing to lead the side and manage things as long as the team needs him.   of Australia's T20I team on August 7, 2023. This decision marked a significant milestone in Marsh's career, as he was chosen to lead the national side for their tour of South Africa. Although Marsh was not named as full-time captain following Aaron Finch's retirement, it is likely that Marsh will be given the responsibility to lead the team in the shortest format until the T20 World Cup next year.  In addition to leading the T20I side, Marsh may also be called upon to captain the ODI team for their series in South Africa, scheduled between September 7 and 17, 2023. This potential responsibility comes in light of an injury to Pat Cummins, who fractured his wrist during the fifth Ashes Test. Cummins' injury requires a six-week rehabilitation period, making his participation in the South Africa series uncertain. Marsh's leadership experience, both at the domestic level and in the Big Bash League, coupled with his all-around capabilities, make him a strong candidate for these roles. He has previously led Perth Scorchers and Western Australia, demonstrating his ability to handle pressure in crucial moments of the game.  As Australia prepare for their tour of South Africa, all eyes will be on Mitchell Marsh. His performance in this series could potentially cement his position as a future leader for Australian cricket. ""It's certainly been a crazy year. Throw in getting married, it's been a good one,"" Marsh said.  ""We’ll get through South Africa and see how we go. I’m available to captain for as long as the team needs me. We’ll see where it all ends."" Cummins, who will lead Australia at the ODI World Cup, is likely to join the team in South Africa but will be available for action only during the 3-match ODI series in Indai later in September.  Marsh said he would probably not ""try to reinvent the wheel"" while captaining Australia for three one-dayers and five T20s in South Africa. ""I think the most important thing I’ve learnt about leadership is staying true to yourself,"" he said. ""Hopefully I’m a good captain. If not, I won’t be in the job for very long. That’s okay I’m just looking forward to the opportunity."""

Manipur Governor calls for Assembly session on August 29,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/manipur-assembly-221758-16x9.jpg?VersionId=G4PjGM9STqLCsa.ryQG__9Gy4g3u..p0&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Manipur Governor Anusuiya Uikey has summoned the monsoon session of the Assembly on August 29. This comes a day after the state Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister N Biren Singh had on Monday recommended convening the session of the state assembly. ""The Governor hereby summons the 4th session of 12th Manipur Legislative Assembly to meet at 11 am, on Tuesday, the 29th August,"" a notification issued on Tuesday said. Earlier, the Manipur Cabinet had recommended the Governor to convene an Assembly session on August 21. However, the house did not sit on Monday as no notification had been issued by the Governor, creating a dilemma of sorts. It came after 10 Kuki MLAs, cutting across party affiliations, had expressed their inability to attend the assembly session as violence in the northeastern state continued. ""For a normal assembly session, a notification has to be issued 15 days before the beginning of it. No such notification has so far been issued by the Governor's office,” an official told news agency PTI. The state government had, however, asked for the session after a cabinet meeting held earlier this month. ""The state cabinet has recommended to the Hon'ble Governor of Manipur for summoning the 4th session of the 12th Manipur Legislative Assembly on the 21st August, 2023,"" an official statement said on August 4. The previous assembly session was held in March, and violence broke out in the state in May. “The last assembly session was adjourned sine die in March. It is a constitutional obligation that the next session must be held before September 2,"" another official said. The violence in the state erupted in early May after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community’s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. 
Since then more than 160 people have died and several hundreds were injured in ethnic clashes in Manipur. 
Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur’s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mainly in the hill districts.

"iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/iqoo-neo-7-pro-222404-16x9.png?VersionId=Pez8M0R2zkYytpMZoLPZnA2tT9cII48Q&size=690:388,"Listen to Story The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G is probably one of those rare offerings in the sub-Rs 35,000 price segment, which not only promises flagship-grade performance but also delivers it. Of course, this is courtesy of the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip under the hood, which also makes it one of the most affordable phones to be powered by Snapdragon’s last year flagship processor. But, is this enough of a reason to warrant a purchase? Well, actually, there are 4 of them.  If you are on the lookout for a high-performing smartphone on a budget of around Rs 35,000, in this article, we give you 4 reasons why you should consider purchasing the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G and 1 reason why it won’t be your cup of tea. Read on.   iQOO has been boasting about the performance chops of the Neo 7 Pro 5G and so, it is quite apparent that the first reason has to be the phone’s performance. Personally, I have used a bunch of phones around Rs 35,000  that offer commendable performance, like the Nothing Phone (1), Redmi Note 12 Pro+, and most recently, the OnePlus Nord 3. If we take it up a notch, for about Rs 40,000, I have also used the OnePlus 11R. And trust me, as good as the OnePlus 11R is, the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G is, in my books, a better phone, both in terms of price and performance. You see, the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G has been a charmer when it comes to delivering a great performance with great thermals. Of course, handling ordinary tasks is a piece of cake for this phone, but where the Neo 7 Pro 5G really shines is with heavy lifting. Personally, I have used this phone for watching a lot of videos and playing games, and without a shadow of a doubt, the Neo 7 Pro 5G delivers through and through.   The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G offers great performance, but to take advantage of that great performance, you need to have a great display. And the Neo 7 Pro’s 6.78” FHD+ flat AMOLED display, with 10-Bit colours and a 120Hz refresh rate, is one of the best and brightest panels that you get in this price range. One, it is amazing for video playback, with support for HDR10 on YouTube and OTT. Additionally, taps and touches are precise and accurate while gaming, thanks to the 1200Hz touch response rate. Personally, I watched a lot of Netflix on the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G and one time, I watched the entire season of Lookism, an anime, at a stretch, and the experience was good. Plus, the stereo speaker setup on offer sounds good. For listening to music, again, there’s a good amount of depth and I found the overall loudness and clarity to be just fine.  The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G features three cameras at the rear and, of course, the star of the show here is the 50MP primary rear camera with OIS. And while I am sure many of you who must be interested in this smartphone, will be because of its performance chops, trust me when I say this — the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G has been a pleasant surprise when it comes to the camera performance. In a nutshell, I found the iQOO Neo 7 Pro’s rear camera to be quite reliable. The shots captured look just the right amount of vibrant. HDR performance is top-notch. And overall, in good lighting, the 50MP primary camera gives you superb performance for a phone at this price point. The phone also captures some well-detailed selfies. Yes, the portrait mode shots could use slight tuning with edge detection, but overall, selfies taken during the day or night turn out just fine.  The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G has a relatively large 5,000mAh battery with support for superfast 120W charging. Based on my usage, which involves a lot of video calls, texting, watching YouTube and playing Call of Duty for at least an hour daily, I was easily able to hit a day’s worth of endurance, with at least 30% battery left by the time I went to bed, on a consistent basis. Of course, whenever there’s a need for a top-up, trust me, the maximum I have had the phone hooked to the charger has been for just 20 minutes.  Software-wise, the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G boots Funtouch OS 13 atop Android 13, and while I did have my reservations that maybe this would be one area where the phone might disappoint, the good news is, it did not. That said, while Funtouch OS 13 offers improved personalisation options, enhanced privacy and security features, and other useful features for a smooth and seamless experience, the 2 years of Android OS upgrades + 3 years of security patch updates is the only bummer when it comes to future support. Because, while 2 years of software support was the standard until last year, other brands such as OnePlus are offering 3 years of OS upgrades, and Samsung, on the other hand, is promising 4 years of Android OS upgrades for most of its phones. So, this is one area where iQOO could’ve surely done better. "
