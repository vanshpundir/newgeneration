Rayudu became only the second Indian cricketer after Pravin Tambe to feature in the men's CPL. After retiring from IPL and domestic cricket following Chennai Super Kings's triumphant run in 2023, Rayudu  , CSK's sister franchise, for the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA. But due to personal reasons, Rayudu decided to withdraw from the MLC, despite being one of the key signings for the Texas Super Kings. His decision came amidst speculations about a proposed cooling-off period policy by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which could potentially restrict retired players from participating in overseas leagues immediately after their retirement. Rayudu eventually made his CPL debut for St Kitts & Nevis Patriots on August 19 against Trinbago Knight RIders. However, Rayudu did not get an opportunity to bat as the match was affected by rain.  “I have heard some really good things about the league, especially the standard of cricket that’s played here.  I am happy to be part of the St. Kitts & Nevis Patriots,” Rayudu said.  Shedding light on his decision to play in the CPL, Rayudu said he had heard a lot of good things about the T20 league from Kieron Pollard and his former CSK teammate Dwayne Bravo.  “Pollard and Bravo used to talk a lot about the CPL. This is the first time I’m playing in a dressing room without any Indians, so that’s a bit strange and it feels a bit different but they’re really nice people. They have been very warm. “Playing in the CPL is a very different experience as compared to playing in India. They have a lot of music and a lot of fun, it’s all a bit new to me but I’m really enjoying it so far.”"

A speeding truck lost control and hit a tractor before ramming into a moving goods train on the Farakka bridge in West Bengal on Tuesday morning. The 14-wheeler lorry, en route from Malda to Farakka, was hurtling down the bridge at an alarming speed when it slammed into a tractor that was heading in the opposite direction. Struggling to regain control, the lorry careened across the bridge, breaking through the bridge's railing due to its uncontrollable velocity. With its path unobstructed, the lorry then crashed directly into the path of a goods vehicle that was moving along the down rail line, bound for its destination. The cargo train's driver prevented an even greater catastrophe by applying the emergency brakes. Police and railway officials soon reached the spot.

"Realme GT 5 to let you adjust CPU clock speed: What this means, why should you care",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/realme-12-projpg-015435-16x9.jpg?VersionId=ocTeEobr1DaoC6p7KLdPWRxjgNeUxmu8&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Realme has confirmed its plans to launch the Realme GT 5 smartphone, and it's shaping up to be an exciting addition to the market, particularly due to its use of a unique feature that hasn't been officially introduced on other smartphones. The premium 5G phone will be using Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset and will offer an option to directly adjust the CPU clock speed. But, what does this mean, and why should consumers care? Let's find out. In an announcement on Weibo, the tech company revealed that the Realme GT 5 will come equipped with a ""geek performance panel."" While the details are still somewhat scarce, this panel will grant users the ability to fine-tune the clock speed of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 CPU, a functionality not yet seen in mainstream smartphones.  Screenshots of this intriguing feature, shared by known leaker Digital Chat Station, hint at a granular level of control. Users will have the ability to independently adjust the clock speeds of the high-performance, mid-range, and low-power CPU cores. It is unknown whether the company will let people make changes on a per-app basis, but this option would prove to be very useful if the company does add support. Realme is also expected to provide an option to revert to default settings in case users get confused and go in the wrong direction. This marks a potentially groundbreaking development, as traditionally, such CPU clock speed adjustments needed root access and select third-party apps, as first reported by . Adjusting CPU clock speed enables users to tailor their device's performance to their specific needs. For resource-intensive tasks like gaming or video editing, you can increase the clock speed to boost performance, resulting in smoother gameplay and faster video rendering. Conversely, for everyday tasks like browsing or reading emails, you can reduce the clock speed to save battery life and reduce heat generation. The ability to adjust a phone's CPU clock speed allows users to optimize their device's performance, battery life, and heat generation according to their specific preferences and needs. It remains to be seen how this feature will work and whether this will become a trend among premium phones in the near future. The official launch of the Realme GT 5 is scheduled for August 28 in China, with global availability details yet to be disclosed. But, since Realme brings almost most of its 5G phones to the Indian market, we expect the company to announce the new offering under the GT series in this country too. So far, there are no details on when this would arrive. "

"IBM CEO says ChatGPT-like AI models will impact white collar work, make companies more productive",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/ibm-221921-16x9.jpg?VersionId=YZJV3fNGUsbJ.U0237d66CeTRI5ugllR&size=690:388,"Listen to Story IBM's chairperson and CEO, Arvind Krishna, has stated that generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, including ChatGPT and Google Bard, can enhance productivity, although they might impact ""back office, white-collar"" work. In an interview with CNBC, Krishna also pointed out the declining or stable population growth in developed countries and expressed that AI technologies could ensure a ""quality life."" These remarks from the IBM CEO come amid the American tech giant's renewed efforts to capitalise on the AI boom. Recently, IBM introduced WatsonX - a suite of generative AI platforms designed to assist enterprises in safely harnessing this technology. During the interview, Krishna also stated that AI models, like ChatGPT, can help with productivity with fewer employees. He said, ""That means you can get the same work done with fewer people. That's just the nature of productivity. I actually believe that the first set of roles that will get impacted are — what I call — back office, white-collar work.""  The IBM CEO was mainly referring to the job trends in developed economies. He suggests there is ""a disinflation in the demographics,"" leading to a decline in the size of the working-age population. He was also clarifying his old remarks about IBM's evolving work practices and potential job cuts at the company.   In a separate interview in May, Krishna said that IBM might replace 30 per cent of jobs with AI or some form of automation technology. As a result, many feared that the company would cut 7,800 jobs in the next five years. Clarifying his old statement, Krishna suggested that new technology replace office work, which also happens at IBM. He notes: ""What I said was we are not going to backfill those roles for the next five years. I said, hey, if I dig that we normally churn (jobs) five-six per cent a year, over five years, that's about 30 per cent of those roles will not need to get backfilled. Labour or AI bots augmenting and working alongside their fellow humans doing that work. So, that is where the 7800 came from. Similar remarks have come from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google chief Sundar Pichai. Both CEOs have stated that AI would serve as an enabler and eliminate mundane tasks. However, some tech experts also expressed concerns that AI technology, particularly freely accessible chatbots like ChatGPT, might lead to unintended consequences, including racial bias. The pioneers of this technology, including OpenAI - the creator of ChatGPT, believe that a certain level of government regulation is crucial."

The app was originally released in 2020, but it has recently been updated to allow iPhone users to slap two iPhones together to create a ""fake"" Galaxy Fold.  In terms of how the app works, it essentially starts a simulation of the Galaxy phone on the iPhone. Once started, the virtual Galaxy Fold, created using iPhones - requiring the use of two iPhones simultaneously to operate the two screens - will operate in a manner similar to the Galaxy Fold 5. You can open and close apps within the simulation, and you can even utilize the apps that come preinstalled on the phone within Samsung's UI. Furthermore, the update also incorporates app support for up to 20 languages, encompassing Korean, Czech, Hungarian, Latin American Spanish, and Russian. To use the Samsung Galaxy ""Try Galaxy"" app: 
- Visit trygalaxy.com/ 
- Add the app to your iPhone's home screen. 
- Launch the app and tap on ""Try Fold."" 
- Simultaneously repeat the same process on your second iPhone. 
- The two iPhones will be connected using an in-app code. 
- Once set up, both iPhones will combine into one screen, providing a glimpse of the Samsung Fold phone experience. The Try Galaxy app does more than just let users experience the size and aspect ratio of a Galaxy phone. When the app is in use, it also displays One UI 5.1.1, giving iOS users a taste of what Galaxy users see every day. This includes features like Quick Share and Samsung Health's fitness suite. The app even has an ""experience"" that lets users explore the Galaxy Z Flip and Fold's FlexCam mode, which takes advantage of the inner and outer displays. This is something that is not possible on the iPhone lineup.

The singers are currently seeking new management, according to a report by Billboard, following their recent departure from manager Scooter Braun. Demi Lovato had been associated with Braun and his SB Projects company since 2019 before she was managed by Phil McIntyre of PhilyMack.  Though Lovato desired a new direction, she expressed gratitude for her time with SB Projects. At present, Lovato has not finalised any new management, but she is exploring potential options.  Under Braun's management, Lovato released two albums – her 2021 Dancing with the Devilâæ the Art of Starting Over, which reached the No. 2 spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the second, 2020's pop-punk album Holy Fvck, which peaked at No. 7 on the same chart.  Lovato has achieved significant success in her career, with 36 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 since 2008, including four top 10 hits. Furthermore, all eight of her studio albums have debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard 200, with 2009's Here We Go Again even reaching No. 1. Fans of Lovato are looking forward to her upcoming release, Demi Lovato Revamped, set to come out on September 15. This album features rock versions of her biggest hits, including Heart Attack, Sorry Not Sorry featuring Slash, Cool For the Summer, and more. Ariana Grande has also parted ways with her longtime manager Scooter Braun, as reported by Puck News on Monday.  Grande had been with Braun and his SB Projects since 2013 when she released her debut album, Yours Truly. She had previously praised Braun as an incredible businessman who was passionate about her project in a 2013 interview with Elle. Grande briefly fired Braun in 2016, which he attributed to ""s—-y boyfriends."" In a 2018 interview with Variety, Braun revealed that he had waited for Grande to come back to him, and when she did, they had an honest conversation. Their relationship was further solidified when Braun assisted Grande in organising a benefit concert in Manchester following the 2017 terrorist attack at her show. SB Project's artist roster still includes Justin Bieber, a longstanding client of Braun's.  It is important to note that in 2021, Braun sold SB Projects' parent company, Ithaca Holdings, to the South Korean entertainment giant HYBE. Despite the sale, SB Projects continues to operate under HYBE, with Braun assuming the role of HYBE America's CEO.  Earlier this year, Braun assisted HYBE in acquiring the leading hip-hop label Quality Control."

"Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi once tried delivering food, but struggled with finding addresses",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/uber-020449-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=G4Crr4GAEy1kwBSKzI1WHCSs9xNTr86h&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Getting a firsthand taste of life on the other side, Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, took on the role of a delivery driver to gain insights into the challenges faced by those who work for his company. This experience shed light on the complexities of being an Uber driver, especially when it comes to food delivery. In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Khosrowshahi revealed his struggles with delivering food rather than transporting riders. He recounted a particular incident where he found it perplexing to locate the drop-off point for a food order. Navigating through intricate apartment complexes turned out to be a daunting task, highlighting one of the major challenges faced by delivery drivers. Uber has been working to tackle this issue by providing more precise drop-off pins to users. Despite the difficulties, Khosrowshahi's experience wasn't entirely negative. He shared an amusing anecdote about delivering food to a touch football game. Instead of a building, he found himself on a field surrounded by a group of people playing the game. Moments like these revealed the diverse scenarios that drivers encounter during their shifts. Khosrowshahi emphasized the importance of understanding the challenges faced by Uber drivers. He believes that fostering better working conditions starts with corporate employees immersing themselves in the driver experience and gaining firsthand knowledge of the job. This approach aligns with his previous move to become an Uber driver himself in September, aiming to grasp the reasons behind a slowdown in driver recruitment. During his stint as an Uber driver, Khosrowshahi unveiled several surprising aspects of the job. Delivering food on an electric bike brought attention to the practice of ""tip-baiting,"" where customers initially promise substantial tips but later reduce them post-delivery. This practice, drivers argue, affects their ability to earn a fair wage. Additionally, driving riders to their destinations exposed him to a range of experiences, from passengers sharing personal problems to discussing confidential corporate matters. The challenges faced by Uber drivers aren't limited to just the nature of the job. Passengers have been known to be disruptive, causing disturbances, leaving behind messes, and being tardy. In response to concerns about driver compensation, some local governments have taken steps to address the issue. New York City recently passed a law requiring delivery drivers to earn a minimum of $18 per hour, while Minneapolis is considering a bill to raise the pay of rideshare drivers. Khosrowshahi's venture into the driver's world highlighted the multifaceted challenges these workers encounter. However, even as he confronted the difficulties faced by drivers, he was taken aback by a different perspective as a passenger. A short Uber ride in New York City turned out to be much more expensive than expected, showing that the intricacies of the ride-sharing world can surprise even those at the top."

"IIT Madras, UAE develop innovative cooling solution for electronics applications",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/iit-madras-221038-16x9.jpg?VersionId=xwIOf9Bxi2tgu.VQ8g4ZjFxTMyyplOtS&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) and Khalifa University, UAE, have made significant strides in advancing heat management for miniature electronic devices, particularly for space applications. The researchers’ latest breakthrough in mini-channel heat exchangers has been published in the reputed peer-reviewed journal Applied Thermal Engineering (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121064). The research paper was co-authored by Professor S Vengadesan, Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras and his Research student, R. Vishnu, along with Dr Ahmed Alkaabi and Dr Deepak Selvakumar from Khalifa University. India's second Space Age has been driven by impressive technological innovations and the miniaturisation of electronic components, enabling advanced functionalities, exemplified by the ongoing Chandrayaan-3 mission. However, the extensive use of miniaturised electronic components, both in space missions and consumer electronics, leads to significant heat generation. High-performance computing processors can generate up to 200-250 W or more of power, resulting in heat loads of up to 1 kW, necessitating efficient heat management. Liquid-cooling systems, especially micro/mini-channel heat sinks, are considered best suited for dissipating heat in such systems. The research conducted by the IIT Madras team aims to disrupt the smooth flow inside the mini-channels through the use of plate electrodes. Elaborating on the significance of this research, Professor S. Vengadesan, Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras, said, “The new design developed by this research team uses thin plate electrodes that introduce swirling flows inside mini-channel fluids, which result in the formation of vortices at the boundaries, which in turn facilitates better heat transfer."" To validate the design, the researchers employed computational methods that simulate fluid flows in three dimensions. Through these simulations, they observed how the chaotic swirling flows effectively disrupted the smooth flow at the walls of the channels, and thereby enhanced heat transfer. The electrodes induce vortices at the boundary layer due to the Onsager-Wien effect and disrupt the smooth flow. The use of a weak electric field to induce swirling flow in minichannels renders the application operationally safe and low power-consuming. The study's applications in electronic thermal management, particularly in space technology, are vast. Additionally, the electrically driven flow vortices generated by this design eliminate the need for additional geometrical modifications. With no moving parts, this design operates without vibration and requires no maintenance. Furthermore, its electrically operated nature ensures intelligent control and quick response. 
 
 The team plans to optimise the design by considering different electrode positions and orientations. Additionally, the mechanism identified in this study holds great promise for enhancing thin-film boiling and the team proposes to extend the application of the design to two-phase heat transfer systems.

"Focus on rational thinking, not religious ideologies in higher edu: Karnataka CM",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/institutes-need-to-focus-on-rational-thinking-over-religious-ideas-karnataka-cm-224651-16x9.jpg?VersionId=Kil2LngfRIjZ.ZWJGQ.2f11Fh2PVJ98F&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah stressed on Monday that higher education institutions need to foster scientific and rational thinking amongst students rather than promoting religious ideologies. This development was announced during a meeting he had with various vice-chancellors and officials of the Higher Education department at Vidhana Soudha. Siddaramaiah opined that the education imparted at universities should not be influenced by any form of social bias such as caste, religion, or language. He reassured that any activities against the principles of the Indian Constitution should be abstained from, particularly within universities. ""If students emerge from universities ignorant and rigidly holding onto their caste affiliations, then what they have received cannot truly be regarded as an education,"" the CM was quoted as saying. Siddaramaiah firmly stated that university-based learning should hold a torch to rationality and scientific thinking, as opposed to being conservative or being inclined towards particular faiths. He also mentioned that certain university-hosted meetings and ceremonies he attended did nothing but undermine the contributions of freedom fighters, constitution writers, and social thinkers. ""Anti-secular thinking should not be rewarded within higher education settings as it could potentially influence students' impartiality,"" the CM cautioned. He advised against organising such programmes, suggesting that a wholesome society can only be obtained if higher education takes the correct track. Siddaramaiah also proposed that the ""fruits of research"" produced by universities should not be confined to their libraries. Instead, he urged that it should be relevant and widely disseminated in society, thereby benefiting the people at large.

Hailing from Agra's Rami Gadi village in Etmadpur tehsil, Divya's pursuit of success was shaped by her tenacity and the unwavering support of her mother, who despite being unable to complete her studies herself, made sure no stone was left unturned for her daughter to go all the way. This was Divya’s third attempt at the prestigious exam. Last time, she couldn't crack the exam just for two marks, but this year, she found her name right at the top of the list of deputy collectors (sub-divisional magistrates). Armed with an MSc in statistics from St. John's College, Divya now envisions uplifting girls and women in rural areas through quality education, vocational training and self-group groups for financial stability With her feet firmly rooted in her humble beginnings and eyes set on her future goals, Sikarwar is nothing short of a beacon of inspiration. Coming from a well-grounded family background which comprises of her grandmother, parents, and two brothers, one of which is preparing for the UPSC prelims, Divya learned the importance of diligence and perseverance at an early age. Her father, a retired BSF official, and her family's main pillar of support, is now engaged in farming. However, victory does not come easy. The civil services examination is a challenging journey that demands patience and dedication. Divya followed a robust preparation plan, making use of resources like Unacademy alongside textbooks like 'Political Science' by Lakshmi Kant and NCERT. “It is imperative to recognise the value of self-study and consistent answer writing practice, which are critical components of this exam,” she says. “To ensure I was well-equipped to excel in this exam, I devoted 8-10 hours of daily study to attending classes and engaging in self-study. During challenging periods, I derived motivation and encouragement from my family, friends, and mentors, which helped me focus on my end goal,” she adds. Divya acknowledges that the Covid-19 pandemic posed unique problems, especially in buying study materials. Undeterred, she navigated these challenges with the support of her family and friends, remaining firmly rooted to her end goal. Recognising the significance of balance, Divya indulged in a range of calming activities to maintain healthy stress levels. “Firstly, I made sure to exercise regularly as it is known to reduce stress levels effectively. A simple walk or jog was enough to help me unwind and reduce anxiety,” she says. “I pursued hobbies that I enjoyed, such as reading or listening to music. Engaging in a hobby helped me take my mind off the exam and reduce stress,” Divya adds. She also spent quality time with her friends and family to keep her mind stress-free. Fuelled by a keen interest in civil services that sprouted during her graduation years, Sikarwar was eager to do something for the country. “I am eager to work with complete dedication towards the development of society through civil services,” she says. Divya shares that each aspirant should find their unique motivation and harness it as a driving force, alongside covering the syllabus entirely and thoroughly. In her words, ""Believing in oneself is essential for success"".  “I advise students to cover the entire syllabus and revise it thoroughly multiple times. It is important to regularly assess your preparation through various test series to identify areas that require more attention and improvement,” she says. “In addition, seeking the support and guidance of parents and friends can also provide invaluable encouragement and motivation,” she adds. 
 
 Indeed, with her triumph, Divya Sikarwar has not only secured her career but has also become a symbol of hope and inspiration for countless students striving towards the same goal."

First published in 1943, it consists of 32 short stories that perfectly capture rural life in that era. The Hitopadesh/Hitopadesha is a collection of stories presumably written in the 12th-century. The origins are unknown but the tales are timeless. With its vibrant illustrations and simple narrative, this book is a delightful way to introduce young children to the concept of days of the week, basic counting, and metamorphosis. The story follows the journey of a caterpillar as it transforms into a beautiful butterfly. A soothing bedtime read, ‘Goodnight Moon’ has been a cherished part of many children's night-time routines.

Ready to captain Australia as long as the team needs me: Marsh ,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/mitchell-marsh-070142-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=DRkGaJplKO.f4dx41naY.UfYcykWCXWo&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Mitchell Marsh expressed delight over the positive turn of events for him in 2023, highlighting his return to Test cricket, marriage and then elevation to captain in T20I cricket. The all-rounder, who has been one of the consistent performers for Australia in the recent past, said he is willing to lead the side and manage things as long as the team needs him.   of Australia's T20I team on August 7, 2023. This decision marked a significant milestone in Marsh's career, as he was chosen to lead the national side for their tour of South Africa. Although Marsh was not named as full-time captain following Aaron Finch's retirement, it is likely that Marsh will be given the responsibility to lead the team in the shortest format until the T20 World Cup next year.  In addition to leading the T20I side, Marsh may also be called upon to captain the ODI team for their series in South Africa, scheduled between September 7 and 17, 2023. This potential responsibility comes in light of an injury to Pat Cummins, who fractured his wrist during the fifth Ashes Test. Cummins' injury requires a six-week rehabilitation period, making his participation in the South Africa series uncertain. Marsh's leadership experience, both at the domestic level and in the Big Bash League, coupled with his all-around capabilities, make him a strong candidate for these roles. He has previously led Perth Scorchers and Western Australia, demonstrating his ability to handle pressure in crucial moments of the game.  As Australia prepare for their tour of South Africa, all eyes will be on Mitchell Marsh. His performance in this series could potentially cement his position as a future leader for Australian cricket. ""It's certainly been a crazy year. Throw in getting married, it's been a good one,"" Marsh said.  ""We’ll get through South Africa and see how we go. I’m available to captain for as long as the team needs me. We’ll see where it all ends."" Cummins, who will lead Australia at the ODI World Cup, is likely to join the team in South Africa but will be available for action only during the 3-match ODI series in Indai later in September.  Marsh said he would probably not ""try to reinvent the wheel"" while captaining Australia for three one-dayers and five T20s in South Africa. ""I think the most important thing I’ve learnt about leadership is staying true to yourself,"" he said. ""Hopefully I’m a good captain. If not, I won’t be in the job for very long. That’s okay I’m just looking forward to the opportunity."""

Manipur Governor calls for Assembly session on August 29,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/manipur-assembly-221758-16x9.jpg?VersionId=G4PjGM9STqLCsa.ryQG__9Gy4g3u..p0&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Manipur Governor Anusuiya Uikey has summoned the monsoon session of the Assembly on August 29. This comes a day after the state Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister N Biren Singh had on Monday recommended convening the session of the state assembly. ""The Governor hereby summons the 4th session of 12th Manipur Legislative Assembly to meet at 11 am, on Tuesday, the 29th August,"" a notification issued on Tuesday said. Earlier, the Manipur Cabinet had recommended the Governor to convene an Assembly session on August 21. However, the house did not sit on Monday as no notification had been issued by the Governor, creating a dilemma of sorts. It came after 10 Kuki MLAs, cutting across party affiliations, had expressed their inability to attend the assembly session as violence in the northeastern state continued. ""For a normal assembly session, a notification has to be issued 15 days before the beginning of it. No such notification has so far been issued by the Governor's office,” an official told news agency PTI. The state government had, however, asked for the session after a cabinet meeting held earlier this month. ""The state cabinet has recommended to the Hon'ble Governor of Manipur for summoning the 4th session of the 12th Manipur Legislative Assembly on the 21st August, 2023,"" an official statement said on August 4. The previous assembly session was held in March, and violence broke out in the state in May. “The last assembly session was adjourned sine die in March. It is a constitutional obligation that the next session must be held before September 2,"" another official said. The violence in the state erupted in early May after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community’s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. 
Since then more than 160 people have died and several hundreds were injured in ethnic clashes in Manipur. 
Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur’s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mainly in the hill districts.

"iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/iqoo-neo-7-pro-222404-16x9.png?VersionId=Pez8M0R2zkYytpMZoLPZnA2tT9cII48Q&size=690:388,"Listen to Story The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G is probably one of those rare offerings in the sub-Rs 35,000 price segment, which not only promises flagship-grade performance but also delivers it. Of course, this is courtesy of the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip under the hood, which also makes it one of the most affordable phones to be powered by Snapdragon’s last year flagship processor. But, is this enough of a reason to warrant a purchase? Well, actually, there are 4 of them.  If you are on the lookout for a high-performing smartphone on a budget of around Rs 35,000, in this article, we give you 4 reasons why you should consider purchasing the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G and 1 reason why it won’t be your cup of tea. Read on.   iQOO has been boasting about the performance chops of the Neo 7 Pro 5G and so, it is quite apparent that the first reason has to be the phone’s performance. Personally, I have used a bunch of phones around Rs 35,000  that offer commendable performance, like the Nothing Phone (1), Redmi Note 12 Pro+, and most recently, the OnePlus Nord 3. If we take it up a notch, for about Rs 40,000, I have also used the OnePlus 11R. And trust me, as good as the OnePlus 11R is, the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G is, in my books, a better phone, both in terms of price and performance. You see, the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G has been a charmer when it comes to delivering a great performance with great thermals. Of course, handling ordinary tasks is a piece of cake for this phone, but where the Neo 7 Pro 5G really shines is with heavy lifting. Personally, I have used this phone for watching a lot of videos and playing games, and without a shadow of a doubt, the Neo 7 Pro 5G delivers through and through.   The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G offers great performance, but to take advantage of that great performance, you need to have a great display. And the Neo 7 Pro’s 6.78” FHD+ flat AMOLED display, with 10-Bit colours and a 120Hz refresh rate, is one of the best and brightest panels that you get in this price range. One, it is amazing for video playback, with support for HDR10 on YouTube and OTT. Additionally, taps and touches are precise and accurate while gaming, thanks to the 1200Hz touch response rate. Personally, I watched a lot of Netflix on the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G and one time, I watched the entire season of Lookism, an anime, at a stretch, and the experience was good. Plus, the stereo speaker setup on offer sounds good. For listening to music, again, there’s a good amount of depth and I found the overall loudness and clarity to be just fine.  The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G features three cameras at the rear and, of course, the star of the show here is the 50MP primary rear camera with OIS. And while I am sure many of you who must be interested in this smartphone, will be because of its performance chops, trust me when I say this — the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G has been a pleasant surprise when it comes to the camera performance. In a nutshell, I found the iQOO Neo 7 Pro’s rear camera to be quite reliable. The shots captured look just the right amount of vibrant. HDR performance is top-notch. And overall, in good lighting, the 50MP primary camera gives you superb performance for a phone at this price point. The phone also captures some well-detailed selfies. Yes, the portrait mode shots could use slight tuning with edge detection, but overall, selfies taken during the day or night turn out just fine.  The iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G has a relatively large 5,000mAh battery with support for superfast 120W charging. Based on my usage, which involves a lot of video calls, texting, watching YouTube and playing Call of Duty for at least an hour daily, I was easily able to hit a day’s worth of endurance, with at least 30% battery left by the time I went to bed, on a consistent basis. Of course, whenever there’s a need for a top-up, trust me, the maximum I have had the phone hooked to the charger has been for just 20 minutes.  Software-wise, the iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G boots Funtouch OS 13 atop Android 13, and while I did have my reservations that maybe this would be one area where the phone might disappoint, the good news is, it did not. That said, while Funtouch OS 13 offers improved personalisation options, enhanced privacy and security features, and other useful features for a smooth and seamless experience, the 2 years of Android OS upgrades + 3 years of security patch updates is the only bummer when it comes to future support. Because, while 2 years of software support was the standard until last year, other brands such as OnePlus are offering 3 years of OS upgrades, and Samsung, on the other hand, is promising 4 years of Android OS upgrades for most of its phones. So, this is one area where iQOO could’ve surely done better. "

"Over 1000 AI bots on X aka Twitter stealing selfies of users to create fake accounts, reports reveal  ",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/x-095924-16x9_6.jpg?VersionId=vhEU8NbONt8gYGK5RYWunNjqdhGZXzW0&size=690:388,"Listen to Story A recent study by researchers from Indiana University has highlighted a problem on social media platform formerly known as Twitter, now called X. The study discovered around 1,140 artificial intelligence-powered accounts on X, which they named the ""Fox8"" botnet. These accounts use technology like ChatGPT to create fake content and steal pictures to create fake profiles. As per the New York Post, the researchers found that these bot accounts aim to trick people into investing in fake cryptocurrencies. They even suspect that the bots might have stolen from real crypto wallets. These accounts often use hashtags like #bitcoin and #crypto and interact with real human-run accounts that focus on crypto news. “With the advent and availability of free AI APIs [application programming interfaces] like ChatGPT, we wanted to see if these tools are already being exploited to fool people. And it turns out they are, sadly but not surprisingly,” one of the researchers told The Post. Apart from promoting fake cryptocurrencies, the Fox8 botnet accounts also spread misinformation on various topics, including elections and public health issues. The bots flood the platform with numerous AI-generated posts. By doing this, they increase the chances of their fraudulent posts being seen by real users and increase the likelihood of someone clicking on harmful links. To seem more human-like, these bots not only use stolen photos but also interact with each other and have a certain number of followers and friends. The study noted that these accounts have improved in their believability due to advancements in language models like ChatGPT. Although the researchers didn't reveal the specific accounts involved, they discovered some of them accidentally through revealing tweets. The study suggests that a significant portion of the accounts using certain phrases were likely bots generating content with the help of AI models. The researchers concluded that this issue might just be the beginning, as more sophisticated malicious bots could go undetected. They called for better measures and regulations to counter this problem, as current methods struggle to identify AI-generated content. It's important to note that after the study was published, X reportedly took down the 1,140 bot accounts. However, the researchers also mentioned that X hasn't been very responsive to their findings. When approached for a comment, X provided an automated response promising further communication.

These scammers pretend to be important people from work, like bosses or colleagues and sometimes senior executives of big companies. By doing this, they make their schemes seem more real. As per IANS report, employees who used to work at a big media company in the main city received many of these fake international calls. The callers, claiming to be high-up executives, asked them to start talking. The scammers also sent messages like ""Reply to me when you see this. Thanks."" These messages seemed to be from top bosses. The fake calls appeared to be from American numbers, with codes like +1 (404) for Atlanta, Georgia, and +1 (773) for Chicago, Illinois. Just a few months ago, many people in India were puzzled by numerous unwanted calls from other countries. These calls put people in danger of losing money or revealing personal information. People received these calls from faraway places like Africa and Southeast Asia. They also got strange messages from people they didn't know. This flood of unwanted stuff made WhatsApp hard to use. About 500 million folks in India use WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta. Although the numbers seemed to come from countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Ethiopia, that wasn't always true. These tricky calls didn't necessarily come from these places. Many of them began with numbers like +251 (Ethiopia), +62 (Indonesia), +254 (Kenya), and +84 (Vietnam). 
There's another scam going on too. Some people in India are getting fake job offers through WhatsApp messages. People need to be careful and not fall for these tricks. It's important to stay cautious when using WhatsApp and other messaging apps. To stay safe from scams on platforms like WhatsApp, verify identities before sharing personal info. Enable 2FA, be cautious of links, and block/report spam. Update apps, educate yourself about common scams, and use privacy settings. Share safety tips with family, trust instincts, and secure devices with strong passwords. Avoid sensitive activities on public Wi-Fi. Regularly review accounts for unauthorized transactions."

He has accused them of cheating under sections 34, 419, and 420 of the IPC Act, as well as sections 66(c) and 66(d) of the Information Technology Act. The case highlights the dangers of online fraud and the importance of being cautious while sharing personal and financial information over the internet. This incident serves as a reminder for everyone to be wary of unexpected job offers and requests for personal details, especially when they come through unsolicited messages. It's crucial to verify the authenticity of such communications and refrain from sharing sensitive information without proper verification. Here is what you can do to stay safe: — Before applying for any job online, research the company and the job offer. Check the company's website and social media pages, and look for reviews from other job seekers. —If you receive an unsolicited job offer, be wary. Legitimate companies do not typically reach out to potential candidates out of the blue. —No legitimate company will ask you to pay for anything upfront, such as training materials or application fees. — Don't share your personal information, such as your Social Security number or bank account information, with anyone you don't know and trust. —If something about a job offer seems off, it probably is. Don't be afraid to walk away from a job offer that makes you feel uncomfortable.

"CEO who fired 900 employees via Zoom call, went through leadership training to make his staff trust him",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/vishal-garg-262403-16x9.png?VersionId=aYeOVtXRe4B61t5UCWamR7.FcoqRTFFO&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Better.com CEO Vishal Garg, who was in news for all the wrong reasons, is training to be a better leader. The company hogged limelight when Garg, its CEO, ruthlessly fired around 900 employees over a Zoom call. The indecent took place when the world was shut down due to Covid and most employees were working from home. Now in a recent interview with TechCrunch, Garg revealed he's ""worked really, really hard"" to be a kinder boss. Garg is most famous for firing many workers from Better.com with a tough video call in 2021. Back then, he accused around 250 employees who were let go of taking more money from the digital mortgage company by saying they worked more hours than they actually did, according to Fortune magazine. Later on, Garg admitted to his remaining staff that he had made a big mistake in how he did the firings. He told TechCrunch, an online publication, that he underwent a lot of training to become a better leader and regain the trust of his staff after that bad video call. ""So I've worked really, really hard to change the way that I show up to the team every day, and to be more empathetic and to treat them with the same level of kindness that I showed our customers,"" Garg told TechCrunch. In an interview released on Wednesday, Garg said he put in a lot of effort to change how he interacts with his team every day. He wanted to be more understanding and treat them as nicely as he treats the company's customers. Garg mentioned that he used to be very focused on the company's mission and its growth, as well as satisfying customers. However, he realized that he also needed to make sure his employees felt happy if he wanted the company's customers to feel the same way. At present, Better.com has close to 1,000 employees, according to Garg.Recently, Garg's company went public through a deal with a company called Aurora Acquisition Corp. This deal had been postponed for a while. Better.com's shares started being traded on the Nasdaq stock market using the symbol BETR. However, when trading started, the stock's value dropped by more than 90%, which is a significant decrease. A representative for Garg didn't respond immediately when asked for a comment by Insider, a news outlet, outside of the usual business hours."

"iPhone 14 Pro available for as low as Rs 1,16,999 ahead of iPhone 15 Pro launch, 4 reasons to buy and 2 reasons to skip",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/iphone-14-pro-255144-16x9.png?VersionId=4r3u5sslQHMspbk57bNgTJUTW.ss5t.A&size=690:388,"Listen to Story The iPhone 14 Pro can now be purchased at a discounted rate on Flipkart, with customers benefiting from a substantial discount of Rs 12,901. Mind you, there’s no ongoing sale right now, so it is likely that this could be a permanent price drop. Moreover, this discounted offer on the iPhone 14 Pro is accessible on both Amazon as well as Flipkart. So, if you have been eyeing the iPhone 14 Pro all this while, now would be the right time to get one. Read on to find out 4 reasons why you should buy the iPhone 14 Pro and 2 reasons why you shouldn’t. Of course, all the necessary details regarding the discount offer are mentioned below. Keep reading.  The iPhone 14 Pro was initially introduced in India with a starting price of Rs 1,29,900 for the 128GB storage option. However, 11 months down, there has been a significant reduction in its price. Presently, you can purchase the iPhone 14 Pro from Amazon or Flipkart at a discounted rate of Rs 1,19,999, excluding any card or sale offers. If you visit Amazon or Flipkart now and check out the iPhone 14 Pro with 128GB storage, you'll find it listed at Rs 1,19,999. Additionally, if you possess an HDFC bank card, you're eligible for an extra discount of Rs 3,000, effectively lowering the iPhone 14 Pro’s price to Rs 1,16,999. Furthermore, if you have an older phone for trade-in, like an iPhone 13 Pro with 128GB you wish to sell, and you're interested in upgrading to the 14 Pro, Amazon is presenting an exchange bonus of up to Rs 37,000, while Flipkart makes it even more lucrative by offering an exchange bonus of up to Rs 50,000. Do note, that this implies that if your older device is in good condition, you can receive a reasonable trade-in value, further decreasing the overall cost of the iPhone 14 Pro. Starting from the iPhone X, all iPhone models have sported a somewhat unattractive notch. However, the iPhone 14 Pro takes a departure from this design by eliminating the notch that previously accommodated the TrueDepth camera system. Instead, Apple has embraced what it terms the ""Dynamic Island"". This innovative feature takes the form of a pill-shaped cutout positioned at the display's top, serving as a home for the camera components. Remarkably, this Dynamic Island can dynamically adjust its shape and size using software, adapting to the content displayed on the screen. Apple emphasizes that this innovation aims to blur the distinction between hardware and software. In real-time, it transforms to showcase alerts, notifications, and ongoing tasks in the area that was once occupied by the notch. The A16 Bionic chip represents a substantial leap beyond the A15 Bionic chip found in the iPhone 13 Pro. When it comes to sheer performance, the A16 Bionic chip showcases remarkable speed gains, surpassing the previous generation by an impressive margin of 40%. Consequently, noticeable improvements in overall performance are evident throughout the phone's operations, enabling fast app launches and improved gaming sessions. The iPhone 14 Pro introduced a new Super Retina XDR display featuring an upgraded 1Hz to 120Hz ProMotion technology. With this, the iPhone 14 Pro became the first iPhone to feature an Always-On display. And when this Always-On display is active, essential information like time, widgets, and Live Activities remain easily visible, and the wallpaper's brightness is reduced. Moreover, beyond the Always-On feature, the iPhone 14 Pro’s display also offers a peak HDR brightness of up to 2000 nits, which aligns it with the capabilities of the Pro Display XDR. It provides the highest level of outdoor brightness ever seen in a smartphone, exhibiting twice the luminosity of the iPhone 13 Pro under sunny conditions. Compared to the 12MP main rear camera of the iPhone 13 Pro, the iPhone 14 Pro showcases a substantial upgrade with its 48MP camera featuring a quad-pixel sensor. This design aggregates every four individual pixels into a larger quad pixel, particularly enhancing low-light performance in most situations. The 48-megapixel lens also introduces a 2x telephoto mode, utilising the central 12 megapixels to capture full-resolution images without resorting to digital zoom. This complements the existing 3x zoom achieved through the dedicated telephoto lens, which has also undergone enhancements for improved performance. Additionally, the TrueDepth front-facing camera has an improved f/1.9 aperture for better low-light selfies and videos, and it also supports autofocus for the first time. As good as the current iPhone 14 deal is, you are most likely to find a far better deal on iPhones abroad. For instance, the iPhone 14 Pro has no ongoing promotion going on in the USA, and despite that, the price of the 128GB model is $999. And even after you add in the local taxes, still, the price after conversion to Indian Rupees is not going to exceed Rs 90,000. This is about Rs 27,000 cheaper than the current Amazon and Flipkart deal. In fact, at a cost of Rs 1,16,000, you can go on a round trip to Vietnam. The round-trip ticket costs about Rs 20,000. While the iPhone 14 Pro is priced at 27,999,000 Vietnamese Dong, which equates to about Rs 96,000. Either way, if you have friends or family living abroad, or if anyone of your known is travelling, it would be better if you could ask them to get an iPhone 14 Pro for yourself.  As good as the iPhone 14 Pro is, it is 11 months old, and September is incoming. For those unaware, the iPhone 15 series is tipped to launch on September 12 or 13, which means, the iPhone 15 Pro is right on the horizon. If leaks and rumours are to be believed, the iPhone 15 Pro is expected to launch with a bunch of features, and going by the word on the street, the phone is not going to be an incremental upgrade. Instead, the phone is believed to be a big update over the iPhone 14 Pro. With expected upgrades such as the newer 3nm A17 Bionic chip, improved camera system, titanium build, new Action button, USB type-C port and more, the iPhone 15 Pro is shaping up to be quite a substantial leap. So, if you are planning to invest a boatload of cash on an iPhone 14 Pro, we’d suggest waiting a while for the iPhone 15 Pro’s pricing and who knows, if there are good launch offers, you might be enticed to buy the newer model instead. What say?! "
Henry Olonga issues public apology after Heath Streak death fiasco,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/henry-olonga-260453-16x9.jpg?VersionId=baQjj8K0ek2X1cpLmk7B8Or5Xm9XIGIt&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Henry Olonga issued a public apology over the Heath Streak death fiasco a few days ago and apologized to the Zimbabwean cricketer and his family.  Olonga prematurely announced the death of his ex-teammate Heath Streak, only to retract his statement later. The incident unfolded in late August 2023, when Olonga, who now resides in Australia, posted on social media that Streak had passed away. This news was based on information he had gathered from three separate sources, including a Zimbabwean sporting forum on Facebook and a tribute from one of Streak's friends. Streak, who is Zimbabwe's all-time leading wicket-taker in Test matches and One Day International (ODI) cricket, was reported to be battling stage four cancer and receiving treatment in South Africa. However, the situation took a dramatic turn when Streak himself  . He expressed his distress over the unverified news spreading on social media, stating that he was 'very upset and hurt'. Following this, Olonga  , admitting that the incident served as a stark reminder of the pitfalls of social media and the importance of verifying facts. Olonga has now sent a public apology to Streak and his family. The pacer opened up about his relationship with the former Zimbabwean skipper and how he has been keeping track of his health. Olonga then said he was informed that Streak's health had taken a turn for the worse and he texted Streak and his wife to verify.  But he did ask some of the friends of Streak's family and they were convinced about the news and he was left devastated.  Olonga said he was extremely sorry for believing the news and apologized to Streak's family.  ""When news came to me that Heath was unwell earlier this year, I made a concerted effort to reconnect after life had us all immersed in our own worlds. Heath has kept me up to date with all that is going on with treatment etc and we have had good contact throughout. The same with Nadine. They are the closest friends I have from the world of Zimbabwe cricket. Most others I have less interaction with. 
In any case, I was informed that Heath had taken a turn for the worse. We were encouraged to write kind words for his eulogy. So it appeared imminent. I will not go into too much detail about how the mis-communication occurred, but rest assured, I heard the story first on Facebook like everyone else. I did immediately text Heath and Nadine to verify. It was a while before they could respond as it was late at night. I texted a few close cricket colleagues who know the family well and they confirmed it was true."" ""I did ask pointed questions to verify but they were convinced. After all I had only heard from Heath the day before so it seemed kind of sudden. But I truly was devastated as I genuinely believed he was gone. And all the emotion I felt I am sure those who encountered the story felt it too."" ""Obviously, I am extremely sorry that I took it as gospel. I then placed my own tributes which seemed to gather a lot of traction ( amongst many tributes out there ) only to get a text from Heath a few hours later in which he asked me to reverse the decision. ( He has always had a great sense of humour ). I then had to back track and attempt to fix the error that unfortunately had gone global. But how can it get fixed easily in this day and age? So I retracted as best I could."" ""I of course profusely apologised to the Streaks after the clanger. They did not need this. In any case, I hope you understand the context now and again appreciate your forgiveness for my part in this unfortunate affair. I am very sad about it."" ""It was extremely heart warming to see how much love there is out there for our champion. Perhaps a silver lining......."" said Olonga in his statement."
9 tech jobs unassailable by AI,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/9-tech-jobs-unassailable-by-ai-251632-16x9.jpg?VersionId=2pxAY2VQUFQeywaR9tAlIY9B6.QkSTXb&size=690:388,"Listen to Story In the midst of an era marked by rapid digital transformation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fundamentally reimagined how we approach technology and data science. However, despite this acceleration, certain career paths in the tech industry remain impervious to total automation. Inextricably linked to human intuition, creative problem-solving and emotional intelligence, these roles remain critical in an AI-dominated landscape. Krishna Kumar, the Founder and CEO of Learnbay, has shared a list of tech positions that remain resistant to automation by AI. Data Science is one field where AI has automated several aspects, like data cleaning and pre-processing. However, at its core, data science requires a level of human intuition and ingenuity that cannot be programmed. While AI can crunch numbers, data scientists pose the right questions, create models tailored to the task at hand, and interpret the results in a meaningful context. The job demands a human's understanding and decision-making abilities that AI cannot fully replicate. With the rise of AI, the need for AI ethicists has become critical. These professionals guide the ethical implementation of AI systems, ensuring they're fair, and transparent, and respect user privacy. They assess potential biases, risks, and social implications that may arise from AI usage. This role requires a deep understanding of social norms, ethics, and human rights - a perspective beyond the scope of AI itself. AI aids cybersecurity by detecting unusual network behaviour or identifying potential threats. Yet, cybersecurity professionals' role remains vital. They strategize, interpret AI's findings, and react to ever-evolving threats creatively. The nuances of the human psyche, understanding the potential motivations of cybercriminals, and the ability to think outside the box are aspects that AI can't mimic. AI has become a valuable tool for software developers, automating code generation, debugging, and testing. However, the creativity required in designing innovative software, understanding user needs, problem-solving, and making intuitive leaps in development are qualities unique to humans. Furthermore, the ethical considerations in software development necessitate human involvement. UX Designers are responsible for creating intuitive and engaging user interfaces. They need to understand human psychology, aesthetics, and cultural nuances to ensure a seamless user experience. AI can help in some aspects, like A/B testing or data analysis, but empathetic design thinking and creativity in creating satisfying user experiences are irreplaceable human traits. DevOps engineers focus on streamlining the development process and fostering collaboration between development and operations teams. While AI can automate parts of the software development lifecycle, the human element is critical for communication, collaboration, and decision-making in this role. AI and Machine Learning (ML) researchers are at the forefront of developing AI. While AI can help in model optimization, the fundamental research that drives AI and ML advancements needs human curiosity, ingenuity, and critical thinking. AI can't question, hypothesize, and innovate like a human researcher. AI can assist in project tracking and risk management, but project managers play an indispensable role. They manage resources, ensure team coordination, solve problems, and make crucial decisions based on their experience and intuition. AI lacks human leadership, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills intrinsic to this role. Data storytellers are experts who convert complex data insights into an engaging narrative. They require a deep understanding of the audience, a sense of context, and creativity to present data compellingly and understandably. AI might handle data but can't tell a story that resonates with humans. As AI technology advances, it's easy to speculate about a future where AI replaces humans. However, the above career paths exemplify that human intuition, creativity, empathy, and complex decision-making abilities are far from obsolete. Instead, the successful professionals of tomorrow will be those who skillfully leverage AI as a tool to augment, not replace, their uniquely human abilities.

"IIT Madras scientists explore interaction between two cyclones, predicts merging",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/iit-madras-263538-16x9.png?VersionId=BN8q52aDC10nfGLI8viuac.4pymR.mHZ&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Over the years, tropical cyclones have ravaged the coastlines of not only the Indian subcontinent, but the whole of southern Asia, Australia, and the tropical regions of the Americas, to name a few. The tremendous havoc and destruction of life and property by these cyclones pose a serious threat to the predominantly agro-based economies of tropical countries. Even today, the mechanisms behind the formation and propagation of these weather extremes and their interactions with the neighbouring weather systems lack a sound understanding and are active areas of research and debate among meteorologists worldwide. One of these important research areas is what happens when two tropical cyclones, in the same hemisphere, are close to each other. In this case, as one cyclone starts affecting the other and vice-versa (this interaction is referred to as “Fujiwhara interaction” by meteorologists), there can be a number of possible outcomes — their trajectories and/or strengths may suddenly change, or they can merge to form a much stronger cyclone. Such binary interaction of cyclones has neither been completely understood nor fully incorporated in weather prediction models and therefore leads to erroneous forecasts. Such inaccurate forecasts increase the threat to life and property due to unpreparedness caused by misinformation and the lack of early warning. Recently, a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras), IIT Hyderabad and Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany have tackled the problem of merging of tropical cyclones by using a novel, data-driven approach based on the interdisciplinary methodology of complex networks in an article titled   published in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science (https://doi.org/10.1063/5. 0101714).  “Analysing cyclone interactions using the novel framework pioneered in this study has the potential to improve the accuracy of the early warning signals provided by meteorological organisations to the government so that they can take pre-emptive and early action to reduce the impact of such disasters.” A complex network encodes the pattern of interaction of a complex system and can be directly applied to study the Fujiwhara interaction between two cyclonic vortices. Indicators derived from this methodology were found to clearly distinguish the different stages of mutual interaction between two cyclones and provide an early indication of cyclone merger, often better than conventionally used indicators such as the separation distance between two cyclones.  “We believe that this network-based approach can be used to study binary cyclone interactions from observational or model-based relative vorticity data to obtain better insights on the possibility of cyclone merger. It paves the path to analyse such highly unusual/rare events in which sudden alteration of cyclone tracks or re-strengthening occurs, on a case-by-case basis, and facilitates improved prediction of cyclone tracks and the fate of such interactions”. 
 
 ,  Data-driven methods for prediction of extreme weather events have a unique advantage since they allow one to identify critical patterns in the evolution of such weather events that are elusive to traditional methods.”"

Liverpool has no space for failure in transfer market: Jurgen Klopp,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/jurgen-klopp-112026-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=b44X4YkRksULhXvSi1FavATqrn1R2HIc&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said that there is not a lot of space for failure for his side in the transfer market as compared to their rivals in the Premier League. During the summer transfer window of 2023, Liverpool underwent significant changes in their squad.  Liverpool's midfield saw a major refresh with the arrivals of  , Dominik Szoboszlai and  . These signings were part of a larger investment exceeding 100 million euros aimed at bolstering the team's midfield department. This move followed the departures of captain Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia. However, the summer window was not just about arrivals. Several stalwarts of the club, including Roberto Firmino, James Milner, Naby Keita, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, were released on free transfers.  Liverpool were also involved in high-profile bids for Moises Caicedo and Roman Lavia, who ended up joining Chelsea. The Reds boss, as quoted by Reuters, said that the margin of error in the transfer market is very less for the club as compared to their rivals in the league. ""We have our situation,"" the German manager told reporters. ""There was one year when money was less of an issue because Phil (Philippe Coutinho) went to Barcelona and we could do two sensational transfers."" ""But we always spend over the years when we have to improve... Since I've been here, we have had to (live within our means). The club has had to, and of course that doesn't make it easier,"" Klopp said. ""The problem is not our situation, it's just in comparison to the other main teams. We have to be on point. That's pretty much the thing. There is not a lot of space for failure."" Klopp went on to say that he is focused on making the most out of the resources available to him, instead of complaining about the money being splashed by other clubs in the market.

India's Butter Chicken makes it to the list of 'surprisingly new iconic dishes',https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/media_bank/202308/butter-chicken-in-the-list-of-surprising-iconic-new-dishes-250713-16x9.jpg?VersionId=egp0u43c7NJOYOQIUt5Zwhup_cwk_o8Q&size=690:388,"Listen to Story Contrary to popular belief, some of the world's most renowned dishes are not as ancient as we might presume. Oftentimes, we tend to unconsciously equate celebrated dishes with a deep-seated heritage, assuming they have been passed down through generations.  However, a fascinating revelation by Taste Atlas, an experiential travel online guide, sheds light on the comparatively nascent origin of some of these iconic culinary creations. The guide recently disclosed a list of delicious and popular dishes that have quite recent origins, debunking many long-held assumptions. ""There is a big chance that your grandparents, parents, and even you are older than some of the world's most popular dishes,"" the caption of the post read. Interestingly, India's revered delicacy, the creamy, flavour-laden butter chicken, was also spotlighted in this roster. While most might envision this perennial favourite as an ancient creation, it was actually conceived only in the mid-twentieth century. According to the list, Mexican snack nachos and Italian pasta carbonara saw their inception as late as the 1940s. The beloved British-Indian fusion, chicken tikka masala, was born only in the 1970s. Sweet tooths will be surprised to find that modern dessert staples such as molten chocolate cake and Italian tiramisu fell onto their dessert plates only in the 1980s and 1960s, respectively. As per the information released by Taste Atlas, the fondly savoured butter chicken came to life in Delhi during the 1950s.  Kundan Lal Gujral, a pioneering restaurateur, launched his venture Moti Mahal where, in a kitchen, a fusion of left-over marinade broth, tomatoes, and generous pats of butter gave birth to the now world-renowned butter chicken. ""The restaurant’s cooks combined leftover marinade juices with tomatoes and butter, and then stewed the tandoor-cooked chicken in it, without even knowing that they have accidentally stumbled upon one of the most loved dishes ever and a future international delicacy,” the description read.  The iconic Moti Mahal later emerged as a key gastronomical destination in Delhi, further popularising butter chicken. This deeply flavoured delicacy, comprising succulent roasted meat drenched in an aromatic, creamy gravy of tomatoes and butter, accompanies naan bread. This dish is frequently embellished with coriander and green chilis."

Special Judge MK Nagpal granted relief to Chidambaram in four cases related to the alleged scams. The cases are being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). In an order passed on August 25, the judge said that the court's directions will not come in the way of any further investigations underway in the matter. In his plea, Chidambaram claimed that he was invited to attend ""a reputed international tennis tournament called St. Tropez Open to be held in St. Tropez, France, from September 18 to 24, and he also had then to travel to London, UK, to meet his daughter, who is working and residing there"". The Congress leader submitted that he was also required to attend some meetings and business activities in London as his company, Totus Tennis Limited, which is a co­-organiser of ATP tournaments, was incorporated in the UK. The counsel appearing on behalf of the CBI as well as the ED opposed Chidambaram's applications. The documents enclosed with the applications do not justify the requirement of the physical presence of the applicant during the tournament in France and the proposed duration of his stay there, and also the need or urgency for the applicant to visit his daughter in the UK, the counsel submitted. The counsel claimed non-cooperation on Chidambaram's part in the ongoing investigation in the money laundering case, adding that some fresh evidence has also surfaced to show that he has disposed of some shares of a company, beneficially owned or controlled by him, and has, thus, ""destroyed the proceeds of crime"". The court directed the accused to furnish a security deposit of Rs 1 crore by way of FDR or bank draft, and directed him to formalise his travel itinerary for the period and place it on record before leaving the country. It also asked for the details of the places or hotels where he would be staying and his contact numbers abroad."
